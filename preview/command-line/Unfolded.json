They produce slow a-temporal resonances throughout time, systematically replicating a western epistemology of management and control. These constructions allowed the contemporary technoscientific management of the environment and of our bodies, producing and reproducing algorithmic and systemic discrimination, which reveal different forms of structural differences and hegemonic fictions.\n</p><p>With-technology, \u201cwe\u201d emerge as \u201cus\u201d. A hybrid human-machine-electron-organism, a planetary/time-space where cables, rare earth, bodies, soil, entities, liquids, particles, atmosphere and outer space are increasingly interconnected in a techno-organism that is speedily evolving, but which gathers in its source code a historical continuum of feedback loops.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In his book <i>Slow Violence</i>, Rob Nixon describes processes characterized by violence that occur gradually and often in invisible ways.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn3_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn3-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Perhaps we can say that the parametric disassembling and reassembling of bodies and territories, is a process of slow violence that brings these problems to the present through their uninterrupted and increasingly sophisticated implementation.\n</p><p>The scientific revolution, understood as a sociotechnical momentum in which the values of Modernity where implemented across western science disciplines, brought a transformation of the way the world was understood, starting off a massive taxonomization and abstraction of the environment. With processes of fragmentation, repeatability and simulation, the splitting of behaviors and organisms into data permeated into the volumetric design of bodies and territories. Since then, we find them embedded in computational software architectures, technologies which relentlessly scan matter in search of new forms of intervention. Hence, so-called bodies, territories, organisms, the organic and the inorganic can be managed for an efficient extraction and manipulation of materials and data, unveiling different forms of possession, property, rights and conflicts.\n</p><p>Statistical techniques of averaging and correlation from the nineteenth century introduced new photographic methods into their analyses, to catalogue organs and matter into static and isolated units. The pictures were organized and categorized by similar units in comparative tables, as for example Alphonse Bertillon\u2019s <i>bertillonage</i>, or Francis Galton\u2019s <i>composites</i>, where images, as slices, were overlapped to reveal a standard for disease, criminal type or race. Reading <i>Volumetric Regimes</i>, we can see how these techniques, initiated by the science of criminology, are nowadays introduced in the form of scanning and modelling technologies to disassemble and reassemble reality. Thus, these <i>us</i>-devices construct artificial borders, isolating groups of archetypes in a desperate will to contain nature\u2019s behavior, analyzed and fixed through parametric systems into physical and digital technoscientific containment architectures. This provides a fantasy of enclosure, preventing the release and spread of an-Other\u2019s influence. A system based on behavioral speculation and probability that creates both new threats and objectives within a retroactive system: a knowledge of the future by probabilistic determinism that continuously feeds a feedback loop of fears and threats, which shapes and reshapes our entire sociality.\n</p><p>In <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> we find, as a kind of resonance chamber full of case studies, an inventory of techniques used in the context of 3D computing to artificially design <i>humanness</i>, referred to as so-called bodies, so-called earth or so-called plants. Mechanisms such as rigging, agential cuts, slicing, dividing, dimensional axes of power, x,y,z, simulated environments, processes of modelling, capturing, rendering, printing and tracking unveil how scientific knowledge incorporated in computational tools is still based on dividing, separating and creating boundaries in a fictional composition of the tangible, in which the world is bounded and organized according to categories of hegemonic fictions. Through this organization, objects and organisms are disintegrated within extreme division and classification, and the isolation of the parts for their analysis erodes the uncategorized interrelations. Imposed official landscapes and bodies disregard the intra-actions \u201cas a dynamism of forces in which all designated \u2018things\u2019 are constantly exchanging and diffracting, influencing and working inseparably.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn4_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn4-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Nevertheless, as the book also points out, new results concerning the origin of matter can lead us to reconsider older categories. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that one cannot simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a single particle. In addition, quantum entanglement means that the quantum state of each particle of a group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when particles are separated by a large distance, and so, also measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In this picture, matter moves increasingly toward a hybrid, ungraspable state. Quantum physics defies the system of observation born with the Modern project. Therefore, concepts such as uncertainty or entanglement, fundamental properties of the very elementary particles of matter (paradoxically resulting from splitting and smashing them to build the provisional Standard Model), can provide us with new generative possibilities and forms of social imagination.\n</p><p>Although liminal matter problematizes the matter of facts, \u201cbodies\u201d are still, and increasingly, locked within a regime of Modernity. As this book shows, this regime quietly and systematically spreads through contemporary 3D computing. Possible Bodies explores in <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> what the imaginary produced within that ontological and epistemological status of computational volumetrics does, and how it intervenes into power relationships. At the same time, they offer us a new imagine-action to rethink previous categorizations, by renaming them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn6_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn6-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> \u201cLanguaging\u201d is one of the main tactics for unsettling Modern assumptions and rigidities. Vocabularies, verbalizations and discourse articulations provide with a rich realm for suspending the probable and extending the spectrum of what\u2019s possible. \u201cIn other words\u201d, language is understood as a mode for keeping complexity close while not aligning with the manners and grammars of a damaging world setting.\n</p><p>Perhaps, following the bug reports included in <i>Volumetric Regimes</i>, we can try to rethink the semantic layer of computational processes. As the image at the beginning of this text suggests, at the basis of computational design, we have mathematical code, a text which, as Possible Bodies proposes, we might need to re-imagine and re-write from scratch.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Foreword&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn1-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn1_1-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Rob Nixon,<i> Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor</i> (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 2011).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\u201cFeedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop.

This question, both modest and enormous, triggered the collaborative research trajectory that is compiled in this book. It was provoked by an intuitive concern about the way 3D computing quite routinely seems to render racist, sexist, ableist, speciest and ageist worlds.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn1_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn1-7\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Asking about what is up with 3D becomes especially urgent given its application in border-patrol devices, for climate prediction modeling, in advanced biomedical imaging or throughout the gamify-all approach of overarching industries, from education to logistics. The proliferating technologies, infrastructures and techniques of 3D tracking, modeling and scanning are increasingly hard to escape.\n</p><p><i>Volumetric Regimes</i> emerges from Possible Bodies, a collaborative, multi-local and polyphonic project situated on the intersection of artistic and academic research, developing alongside an inventory of cases through writing, workshops, visual essays and performances. This publication brings together diverse materials from that trajectory as well as introduces new materials. It represents a rich and ongoing conversation between artists, software developers and theorists on the political, aesthetic and relational regimes in which volumes are calculated. At some point, we decided to fork Possible Bodies into The Underground Division to name the intensifying conversations on 3D-geocomputation with Helen V. Pritchard.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn2_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn2-8\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This explains why the attribution of the materials compiled in <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> takes multiple expressions of an extended <i>we</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn3_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn3-9\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>When we asked \u201cWhat is going on with 3D?!\u201d we generated many further questions, such as: Why is <i>3D</i> now used as a synonym for <i>volume-metrics</i>. Or: how did the metric of volume become naturalized as <i>3D</i>? How are volumes computed, accounted for and represented? Is the three-dimensional technoscientific organization of spaces, bodies or objects only about volume, or rather about the particular modes in which volume is culturally mobilized? How, then, are computational volumes occupying the world? What forms of power come along with 3D? How are the x, y and z axes established as linear carriers or variables of volume, by whom and why? If we take 3D as a noun, it points at the quality of being three-dimensional. But what if we follow the intuition of asking about \u201cwhat is going on\u201d and take 3D as an action, as an operation with implications for the way we can world otherwise? Can 3D be turned into a verb, at all? How can we at the same time use, problematize and engage with the cultures of volume-processing that converge under the paradigm of 3D? \n</p><p>One important question we almost overlooked: What is volume, actually!? Let\u2019s start by saying that as a representation of mass and of matter, volume is a naturalized construction, by means of calculation. \u201c3D\u201d then is a shortcut for the cultural means by which contemporary volume gets produced, especially in the context of computation. By persistently foregrounding its three distinct dimensions: depth, height and width, the concept of volume gets inextricably tied to the Cartesian coordinate system, a particular way of measuring dimensional worlds. The cases and situations compiled in this book depart from this important shift: in computation, volume is not a given, but rather <i>an outcome</i>, and volumetrics is the set of techniques to fabricate such outcome.\n</p><p>As a field oriented towards the technocratic realm of Modern technosciences, 3D computation has historically unfolded under \u201cthe probable\u201d regimes of optimization, totalitarian efficiency, normalization and hegemonic world order.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Think of scanning the underground for extractable petro-fossil resources with the help of technologies first developed for brain surgery, and large scale agro-industrial 3D-applications such as spray installations enhanced with fruit recognition. In that sense, volumetrics is involved in sustaining the all too probable behavior of 3D, which is actively being (re)produced and accentuated by digital hyper-computation. The legacies and projections of industrial development leave traces of an ongoing controversy, where multiple modes of existence become increasingly unimaginable under the regime of the probable. <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> explores operational, discursive and procedural elements which might widen \u201cthe possible\u201d in contemporary volumetrics.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Material_cultures\">Material cultures</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This book is an inquiry into the material cultures of volumetrics. We did not settle on one specific area of knowledge, but rather stayed with the complexity of intricate stories that in one way or another involve a metrics of volume. The study of material cultures has a long tail which connects several disciplines, from archaeology and ethnography or design, which each bring their own methodological nuances and specific devices. <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> sympathizes with this multi-fold research sensibility that is necessary to think-with-matter. The framework of material cultures provides us with an arsenal of tools and vocabularies, interlocuting with, for example, New Feminist Materialisms, Science and Technology Studies, Phenomenology, Social Ecology or Cultural Studies.\n</p><p>The study of the material cultures of volumetrics necessitates a double-bind approach. The first bind relates to the material culture of volume. We need to speak about the volume that so-called bodies occupy in space from the material perspective of what they are made of \u2013 the actual conditions of their material presence and the implications of what space they occupy, or not. But we also need to speak about the material arrangements of metrics, the whole ecology of tools that participate in measuring operations. The second bind is therefore about the technopolitical aspects of knowledge production by measuring matter and of measured matter itself; in other words: the material culture of metrics.\n</p><p>The material culture of volumetrics and its internal double bind implies an understanding of technosocial relations as always in the making, both shaping and being shaped under the conditions of cultural formations. Being sensitive to matter therefore also involves a critical accountability towards the exclusions, reproductions and limitations that such formations execute. We decided to approach this complexity by assuming our response-ability with an inventory filled with cases and an explicitly political attitude.\n</p><p>The way matter matters has a direct affect on how something becomes a structural and structured regime, or rather how it becomes an ongoing contingent amalgamation of forces. There is no doubt that metrics can be considered to be a cultural realm of its own,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn4_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn4-11\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> but what about the possibility of volume as a cultural field, infused by an apparatus of axioms and assumptions that, despite their rigid affirmations, are not referring to a pre-existent reality, but actually rendering one of their own?\n</p><p>In this book, we spend some quality time with the idea that volume, is the product of a specific evolution of material culture. We want to activate a public conversation, asking: How is power distributed in a world that is worlded by axes, planes, dimensions and coordinates, too often and too soon crystallizing abstractions in a path towards naturalizing what presences count where, for whom and for how long?\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Volumetric_regimes_2\">Volumetric regimes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>We started this introduction by saying that volume is an outcome, not a given. Mass can (but does not have to) be measured by culturally-set operations like the calculation of its depth, or of its density. The volumes resulting from such measurement operations use cultural or scientific assumptions such as limit, segment or surface. The specific ways that volumetrics happen, and the modes that result in them crystallizing into axes and axioms, are the ones that we are trying to trace back and forth, to identify how they ended up arranging a whole regime of thought and praxis.\n</p><p>The contemporary regime of volumetrics, meaning the enviro-socio-technical politics and narratives that emerge with and around the measurement and generation of 3D presences, is a regime full of bugs, crawling with enviro-socio-technical flaws. Not neutral and also not innocent, this regime is wrapped up in the interrelated legacies and ideologies of neoliberalism, patriarchal colonial commercial capitalism, tied with the oligopolies of authoritarian innovation and technoscientific mono-cultures of proprietary hardware and software industries, intertwined with the cultural regimes of mathematics, image processing but also overly rigid vocabularies. In feminist techno-science, the relation between (human) bodies and technologies has had lots of attention, from the cyborg manifesto to more recent new materialist renderings of phenomena and apparatuses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn5_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn5-12\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In the field of software studies, the \u201cdeviceful\u201d entanglements between hegemonic regimes and software procedures have been thoroughly discussed,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn6_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn6-13\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> while anti-colonial scholars have critiqued the ways that measuring or metrics align with racial capitalism and North-South divisions of power.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn7_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn7-14\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Thinking about the computation of volume is merely present in literature on the interaction of human and other-than-human bodies with machinic agents,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn8_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn8-15\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> with the built environment<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn9_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn9-16\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> and its operative logics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn10_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn10-17\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>What we have been looking for in the works listed above, and not always found, is the kind of diffuse rigor needed for a transformative politics that is a condition for non-binarism, of not settling, of being response-able in constant change.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn11_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn11-18\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> This search triggered the intense interlocutions with the artists, activists and thinkers that have contributed to this book, and made us stick to polyhedric research methods. We\u2019ve gone back to Paul B. Preciado, who taught us about the political fiction that so-called bodies are, a fleshy accumulation of archival data that keeps producing, reproducing and/or contesting the truths of power and their interlinked subjectivities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn12_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn12-19\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Fired up for the worlding of <i>different tech, </i>we found inspiring unfoldings of computation and geological volumes in Kathryn Yusoff\u2019s and Elizabeth A. Povinelli\u2019s work, who insist on brave unpackings of Modern regimes all-the-way. We wondered about the voluminosity of \u201cbodies\u201c but also about their entanglement with what marks them as such, and how to pay attention to it. Reading Denise Fereirra da Silva\u2019s email conversation with Arjuna Neuman about her use of the term \u201cDeep Implicancy\u201d rather than \u201centanglement\u201d, we were struck by the relation between spatiality and separation she brings up: \u201cDeep Implicancy is an attempt to move away from how separation informs the notion of entanglement. Quantum physicists have chosen the term entanglement precisely because their starting point is particles (that is, bodies), which are by definition separate in space.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn13_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn13-20\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Syed Mustafa Ali and David Golumbia separate computation from computationalism to make clear that while computation obviously sediments and continues colonial damages, this is not necessarily how it needs to be (and it necessarily needs to be otherwise).

If volume does not exist without volumetric regimes, then the technopolitical struggle means to scrutinize how metrics could be exploded, (re)designed, otherwise implemented, differently practiced, (de)bugged, interpreted and/or cared for.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Quantified_presence\">Quantified presence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><i>Volumetric Regimes</i> is also our way to build capacities for a response to the massive quantification of presences existing in computed space-times. Such response-ability needs to be multi-faceted, due to the process of manipulation that quantifying presences apply to presence itself as an ontological concern. The fact that something can exist and be accountable in a virtual place, or that something which is present in a physical space can re-appear or be re-presented in differently mediated conditions, or not at all, is technically produced through supposedly efficient gestures such as clear-cut incisions, separating boundaries, layers of segmentation, regions of interest and acts of discretization. The agency of these operations is more often than not erased after the fact, providing a nauseating sense of neutrality.\n</p><p>The project of <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> is to think with and towards computing-otherwise rather than to side with the uncomputable or to count on that which escapes calculation. Flesh, complexity and mess are already-with computation, somehow simultaneous and co-constituent of mess. The spaces created by the tension between matter and its quantification, provide with a creative arena for the diversification of options in the praxis of 3D computation. Qualitative procedures like intense dialog, hands-on experiments, participant observation, speculative design and indeterminate protocols help us understand possible research attitudes in response to a quantify-all mono-culture, not succumbing to its own pre-established analytics. Could \u201cdeep implicancy\u201d be where computing otherwise happens, by means of speculation, indeterminacy and possibility? Perhaps such praxis is already located beyond or below normed actions like capturing, modeling or tracking that are all so complicit with the making of  fungibility.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn18_24-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn18-24\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The specific form of quantification that is at stake in the realm of volume-metrics, is datafication. The computational processing, displacing and re-arranging of matter through volumetric techniques participates in what The Invisible Committee called<i> the crisis of presence</i>, which can be observed at the very core of the contemporary ethos.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn19_25-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn19-25\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> We connect with their concerns about the way present presences are rendered, or not. How to value what needs to count and be counted or what is in excess of quantification, via the exact same operation, in a politicized way. In other words, a politics of reclaiming quantification is a praxis towards a politicized accountability for the messiness of all techniques that deal with the thickness of a complex world. Such praxis is not against making cuts as such, but rather commits to being response-able with the gestures of discretion and not making final finite gestures, but reviewable ones. Connecting to quantification in this manner, is a claim for forms of accountable accountability.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn20_26-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn20-26\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Aligning ourselves with the tradition of feminist techno-sciences, <i>Volumetric Regimes: Material cultures of quantified presence</i> stays with the possible (possible tools, methods, practices, materializations, agencies, vocabularies) of computation, demanding complexity while queering the rigidity of their fixing of items, discrete and finite entities in too fast moves towards truth and neutrality.\n</p><p>In this publication we try by all means to disorient the assumption of essentialist discreteness and claims for the thickening of qualitative presence in 3D computation realms. In that sense, <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> could be considered as an attempt to do qualitative research on the quantitive methods related to the volumetric-occupation of worlds.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Polyhedric_research_methods\">Polyhedric research methods</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In terms of method, this book benefits from several polyhedric forces that when combined, form a prismatic body of disciplinarily uncalibrated but rigorous research. The study of the complex regimes that rule the worlds of volumes, necessitated a few methodological inventions to widen the spectrum of how computational volumetrics can be studied, described, problematized and reclaimed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn21_27-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn21-27\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> That complexity is generated not only by the different areas in which measuring volumes is done, but also because it is a highly crowded field, populated by institutional, commercial, scientific, sensorial and technological agents.\n</p><p>One polyhedric force is the need for direct action and informed disobedience applied to research processes. We have often referred to our work as \u201cdisobedient action-research\u201d, to insist on a mode of research that is motivated by situated, ad-hoc modes of producing and circulating knowledge. We committed to a non-linear workflow of writing, conversing and referencing, to keep resisting developmental escalation, but rather to hold on to an iterative and sometimes recursive flow. While in every discipline there are people and practices opening, mixing, expanding, challenging, and refusing traditional methods, research involving technology is too often ethically, ontologically, and epistemologically dependent on a path from and towards universalist enlightenment, aiming to eventually technically fixing the world. This violent and homogenizing solutionist attitude stands in the way of a practice that, first of all, needs to attend to the re-articulation and relocation of what must be accounted for, perhaps just by proliferating sensibilities, issues, demands, requests, complaints, entanglements, and/or questions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn22_28-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn22-28\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A second polyhedric force is generated by the playful intersection of artistic and academic research in the collaborative praxis of Possible Bodies. It materializes for example in uncommon writing and the use of made-up terminology, but also in the hands-on engagement with tools, merging high and low tech, learning on the go, while attending to genealogies that arranged them in the here-now. You will find us smuggling techniques for knowledge generation from one domain to another such as contaminating ethnographic descriptions with software stories, mixing poetics with abnormal visual renders, blurring theoretical dissertations with industrial case-studies and so forth.\n</p><p>Trans*feminism is certainly a polyhedric dynamic at work, in mutual affection with the previous forces. We refer to the research as such, in order to convoke around that star (*) all intersectional and <i>intra-sectional </i>aspects that are possibly needed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn23_29-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn23-29\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Our trans*feminist lens is sharpened by queer and anti-colonial sensibilities, and oriented towards (but not limited to) trans*generational, trans*media, trans*disciplinary, trans*geopolitical, trans*expertise, and trans*genealogical forms of study. The situated mixing of software studies, media archaeology, artistic research, science and technology studies, critical theory and queer-anticolonial-feminist-antifa-technosciences purposefully counters hierarchies, subalternities, privileges and erasures in disciplinary methods.\n</p><p>The last polyhedric force is generated by our politicized attitude towards technological objects. This book was developed on a wiki, designed with Free, Libre and Open Source software (FLOSS) tools and published as Open Access.<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> Without wanting to suggest that FLOSS itself produces the conditions for non-hegemonic imaginations, we are convinced that its persistent commitment to transformation can facilitate radical experiments, and trans*feminist technical prototyping.

It also oriented our DIWO attitude of investigation, preferring low-tech approaches to high-tech phenomena and allowing ourselves to misuse and fail.\n</p><p>To give an ongoing account of the structural formations conditioning the various cultural artifacts that are co-composed through scanning, tracking and modeling, we settled for <b>inventorying</b> as a central method. The items in the Possible Bodies inventory do not rarefy these artifacts, as would happen through the practice of collecting, or by pinning them down, as in the practice of cartography, or rigidly stabilize them, as might be a risk through the practice of archiving.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn27_34-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn27-34\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Instead, the inventorying is about continuous updates, and keeping items available.

Bug reporting, as a form of technical grey literature, makes errors, malfunctions, lacks, or knots legible; secondly, it reproduces a culture of a public interest in actively taking-part in contemporary technosciences. As a research method, it can be understood as a repoliticization and cross-pollination of one of the key traditional pillars of scientific knowledge production: the publishing of findings.\n</p><p>Technical expertise is not the only knowledge suitable for addressing the technologically produced situations we find ourselves in.

Although they each take on the question \u201cWhat is going on with 3D?!\u201d through a distinct <i>axiology</i> of technology, politics and aesthetics, they do not assume nor impose a specific order for the reader.

The three Cartesian axes both constrain and orient the chapter, as they do for the space of possibility of the volumetric. It takes seriously the implications of a mathematical regime based on parallel and perpendicular lines, and zooms in on the invasive operations of virtual renderings of fleshy matter, but also calls for queer rotations and disobedient trans*feminist angles that can go beyond the rigidness of axiomatic axes within the techno-ecologies of 3D tracking, modeling and scanning. The chapter begins with a contribution by Sina Seifee, who in his text \u201cRigging Demons\u201c draws from an intimate history with the technical craft-intense practice of special effects animation, to tell us stories of visceral non-mammalian animality between love and vanquish. The chapter continues with a first visit to the Possible Bodies inventory that sets-up the basic suspicions on what is of value in rendered and captured worlds, following the thread of dis-orientation as a way to think through the powerful worldings that are nevertheless produced by volumetrics. \u201cInvasive Imagination and its agential cut\u201c reflects on the regimes of biomedical imaging and the volumetrization of so-called bodies.\n</p><p><i><b>Somatopologies: On the ongoing rendering of corpo-realities</b></i> opens up all the twists in epistemologies and methodologies triggered by <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> in the somatic realm.

By opening up the conditions of possibility, soma-topologies is a direct claim for other ontologies, ethics, practices and crossings. The chapter opens with \u201cClumsy Volumetrics\u201c in which Helen V. Pritchard follows Sara Ahmed\u2019s suggestion that \u201cclumsiness\u201d might form a queer and crip ethics that generates new openings and possibilities. \u201cSomatopologies (materials for a movie in the making)\u201c documents a series of installations and performances that mixed different text sources to cut agential slices through technocratic paradigms in order to create hyperbolic incisions that stretch, rotate and bend Euclidean nightmares and Cartesian anxieties. \u201cCircluding\u201c is a visual/textual collaboration with Kym Ward on the potential of a gesture that flips the order of agency without separating inside from outside. In \u201cFrom Topology to Typography: A romance of 2.5D\u201c, Sophie Boiron and Pierre Huyghebaert open up a graphic conversation on the almost-volumetrics that precede 3D in digital typography and finally the short text \u201cMakeHuman\u201c and the pamphlet \u201cInformation for Users\u201c take on the implications of relating to 3D-modelled-humanoids. \n</p><p>The vibrating connections between hyper-realism and invention, re-creation and simulation, generation and parametrization are the inner threads of a chapter titled <i><b>Parametric Unknowns: Hypercomputation between the probable and the possible</b></i>. What\u2019s in the world and what is processed by mechanisms of volumetric vision differs only slightly, offering a problematic dizzying effect. The opening of the chapter is in the hands of Nicolas Malev\u00e9, who offers a visual ethnography of some of the interiors and bodies that made computational photography into what it became. Not knowing everything yet, the panoramization of intimate atmospheres works as an exercise to study the limits between the flat surfaces of engineering labs and the dense worlds behind their scenes. \u201cThe Fragility of Life\u201c is an excuse to enter into the thick files compiled by designer-researcher Simone C Niquille on the digital post-production of truth. Somehow in line with that, Maria Dada provides an overview of how different training and rehearsing are, especially in the gaming industry that makes History with a capital H. And finally, a long-term conversation with Phil Langley questions the making of too fast computational moves while participating in architectural and infrastructural materializations.\n</p><p><i><b>Signs of Clandestine Disorder: The continuous aftermath of 3D-computationalism</b></i> follows the long tail of volumetric techniques, technologies and infrastructures, and the politics inscribed within. The chapter\u2019s title points to \u201ccomputationalism\u201d, a direct reference to Syed Mustafa Ali\u2019s approach to decolonial computing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn36_43-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn36-43\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> The other half is a quote from Alphonso Lingis, which invokes the non-explicit relationality between elements that constitute computational processes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn37_44-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn37-44\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> In that sense, it contrasts directly with the discursive practice of colonial perception that Ramon Amaro described as \u201cself maintaining in its capacity to empirically self-justify.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn38_45-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn38-45\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> The chapter opens with \u201cEndured Instances of Relation\u201c in which Romi Ron Morrison reflects on specific types of fixity and fixation that pertain to volumetric regimes, and the radical potential of \u201cflesh\u201d in data practices, while understanding bodies as co-constructed by their inscriptions, as a becoming-with technology. The script for the workshop \u201cSigns of clandestine disorder for the uniformed and codified crowd\u201c is a generative proposal to apply the mathematical episteme to lively matters, but without letting go of its potential. In \u201cSo-called Plants\u201c we return to the inventory for a vegetal trip, observing and describing some operations that affect the vegetal kingdom and volumetrics.\n</p><p>The last chapter is titled <i><b>Depths and Densities: Accidented and dissonant spacetimes</b></i>. It proposes to shift from the scale of the flesh to the scale of the earth. The learnings from the insurgent geology of authors like Yusoff triggered many questions about the ways technopolitics cut the vertical and horizontal axis and that limit the spectrum of possibilities to a universalist continuation of extractive modes of existence and knowledge production. The contribution by Kym Ward, \u201cOpen Boundary Conditions\u201c, offers a first approach to her situated intensive study of the crossings between volumetrics and oceanography, from the point of view of the Bidston Observatory in Liverpool. From this vantage point she articulates a critique on technosciences, and provides with an overview of possible affirmative areas of study and engagement. In \u201cA Bugged Report\u201c, the filing of bug reports turns out to be an opportune way to react to the embeddedness of anthropocentrism in geomodeling software tools, different to, for example, technological sovereignty claims. \u201cWe Have Always Been Geohackers\u201c continues that thinking and explores the probable continuation of extractive modes of existence and knowledge production in software tools for rendering tectonic plates. The workshop script for exercising an analog LiDAR apparatus is a proposal to experience these tensions in physical space, and then to discuss them collectively. The chapter ends with \u201cUltrasonic Dreams of Aclinical Renderings\u201c, a fiction that speculates with hardware on the possibilities for scanning through accidented and dissonant spacetimes.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_2\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-7\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn1-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn1_7-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">This intuition surfaced in <i>GenderBlending,</i> a worksession organized by Constant, association for art and media based in Brussels, in 2014.

I was making exploratory locomotor behaviors, scripting postural coordinations, kinesthetic structures, and automated skeletal rigs. Soon after, doing simple computer graphics hacks in 3D became a pragmatic experimentation habit. Now looking back, I think it was a way for me to extend a line of flight.

Broadcast by Warner Bros. Television (aired between 1998 and 2006), the adaption of <i>Charmed</i> for television is a supernatural fantasy soap opera, mixing stories of relations between women and machinic alignments. Faced with the cognitive chaos of a hypermodern life in an imaginary San Francisco, as main characters of the soap, the three sisters-witches deal with questions of narcissism (self-oriented molar life-style), prosthesis (sympathetic magic as new technologies they have to learn to live with without mastering), global networks (teamwork with underworld), and dissatisfaction (nothing works out, relationships fail, anxiety attacks, and loneliness). In the series, ancient forms for life-sources, characterized as \u201cdemons\u201d, are differentiated and encountered via the mediation of a technical life-source, characterized as \u201cmagic spells\u201d. The technology is allegorically replaced by magic.\n</p><p>The soap presents the sisters, Prue, Phoebe, and Piper, oscillating between demon love and demon hate, and constantly negotiating the strange status of desire in general. These negotiations are fabled as the ongoing tensions between <i>hedonism</i> (to refuse to embody anxiety for polyamorous sexual life) and <i>tolerance</i> (the recognition of difference in the demons they must fight to the death) and those tensions are typically worked out melodramatically by the standards of the genre in the 1990s. The characters are frequently wrapped in and unwrapped by emotional turmoil, family discord, marriage breakdown, and secret relationships. They often show minimal interest in magic as a subject of curiosity, and instead they are more interested in spells as a medium through which their demons are externally materialized and enacted. Knowing has no effect on the protagonists\u2019 process of becoming only actions. As such <i>Charmed</i> insists on putting \u201cthe transformation of being and the transformation of knowing out of sync with one another\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn394_50-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn394-50\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_techniques_of_making_species_visible\">Past techniques of making species visible</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:CharmedS1E22.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/0/08/CharmedS1E22.jpg/300px-CharmedS1E22.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"231\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/0/08/CharmedS1E22.jpg/450px-CharmedS1E22.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/0/08/CharmedS1E22.jpg/600px-CharmedS1E22.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:CharmedS1E22.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Disintegration of a demon in <i>Charmed</i>, season 1, episode 22</div></div></div>\n<p>The demons of <i>Charmed</i> are particularly interesting for multiple reasons. First, they are proposed taxonomically. Every demon is particular in its type, or subspecies, and classified per episode by its unique style of death. The demons are often mean-spirited aliens (men in suits), are less narrated in their process of becoming, and rather interested more in the classification of the manner of vanquishing them. They are \u201cvanquished\u201d at the end of each episode. To be more precise, exactly at minute 39, a demon is spectacularly exploded, melted, burned, or vaporized. One of the byproducts of this strange way of relating, is the <i>Book of Shadows</i>, a list or catalogue of demons and their <i>transmodification</i>. Lists are qualitative characteristics of cosmographical knowledge and my favorite specialized archival technology.\n</p><p>As a premodern cutting-edge agent of sorting, list-making was highly functional in the technologies of writing in the 12th and 16th century, namely monster literature, <i>histoire prodigieuse</i> or <i>bestiaries</i>. I have been thinking about bestiaries these past years, as one of the older practices of discovery, interpretation, production of the real itself. Starting off as a research project about premodern zoology in West Asia, Iran in particular, I found myself getting to know more about how \u201csecularization of the interest in monsters\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn395_51-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn395-51\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> happened through time. Bestiaries are <i>synthesized sensitized lists of the strange</i>. In them the enlisted creatures do not need to \u201cstick together\u201d in the sense of an affective or syntagmatic followability. That means they are not related narratively, but play non-abstract categories in their relentless particularities. A creative form of demon literacy, mnemonically oriented (to aid memorization), which is materialized in <i>Charmed</i> as the <i>Book of Shadows</i>. The melodrama affect of the series and emphatic lense on the love life of its cast-ensemble, allows a form of distance, making the demons becoming ontologically boring, which is paradoxically the subject of wonder literature (simultaneously distanced and intimate). On one hand the categorical nature of demons are anatomically and painfully indexed in the series, and on the other hand the romantic qualities of demonic life is explored.\n</p><p>Soap operas are among the most effective forms of linear storytelling in the 20th century, an invention of the US daytime serials. Characteristic of a soap operatic approach, is the use of the cast-ensemble, a collective of (often glamorous and wealthy) individuals who \u201cplay off each other rather than off reality\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn396_52-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn396-52\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> This allows the reality in which the stories go through to be rendered as an ordinary, constant, and natural stage. The soap often produces (and capitalizes on) a fable of reality, as that is the environment where multiple agencies are characteristically coordinated to face each other rather than their environment. Through the creation of banal and ordinary sites of getting on collectively in a romantic life, soup opera series are perhaps among the best tools to create cognitive companions (fans) and the sensation of ordinary affects, which are essential in \u201cworlding\u201d (production of the ordinary sense of a world).\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:DisintegrationEffect2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/7/70/DisintegrationEffect2.png/300px-DisintegrationEffect2.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/7/70/DisintegrationEffect2.png/450px-DisintegrationEffect2.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/7/70/DisintegrationEffect2.png/600px-DisintegrationEffect2.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:DisintegrationEffect2.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i>Disintegration Effect on self</i> by Surfaced Studio in \u201cAfter Effects Expression Controls Tutorial - Visual Effects 101\u201d, 2012, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://youtu.be/jslSJNtoNcg\">https://youtu.be/jslSJNtoNcg</a></div></div></div>\n<p>The second reason to become interested in <i>Charmed</i> demons, is because of its visual effects. The disintegration effects of <i>Charmed</i> demon vanquishing can be perceived as \u201clow tech\u201d, meaning that its images develop a visuality that does not immediately integrate into high-end media in 2021. Its images, as I watched them in my attentive recognition (of a phenomena that is not complying with expectations) and partial attunement (to its explicit intensities), they cultivate my vision as the result of a perceiving organ. Why do I find demon species that depend on \u201cexpired\u201d visualization technologies more interesting? This can be due to my own small resistance against new-media. Not a critical positioning, but more a sensation that has sedimented into an aesthetic taste (that is my consumption habit). The particular simulacral space of contemporary mediascape, with its preference for immersion, viscerality, interactivity, and hyperrealism, has to do with the way new-media makes meaning more <i>attractive</i> and (in a Deleuzian sense) less <i>intensive</i>. <i>Charmed</i>\u2019s mythopoetic dreamscape now in 2021 has lost its \u201cappeal\u201d, therefore it is available to become tasty again. A witness to the gain and loss of attractivity in media culture is the process of fixing \u201cbad\u201d visual effects in the popular YouTube VFX Artists React series by Corridor Crew, in which the crew \u201creact to\u201d and \u201cfix\u201d the media affect of different VFX-intensive movies.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn397_53-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn397-53\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transmission_of_media_affects\">Transmission of media affects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:CollapseWoman1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/c/cb/CollapseWoman1.jpg/300px-CollapseWoman1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/c/cb/CollapseWoman1.jpg/450px-CollapseWoman1.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/c/cb/CollapseWoman1.jpg/600px-CollapseWoman1.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:CollapseWoman1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A disintegrative body rendered in Maya and composed in Fusion (eyeon), 2007.

I remember from my early childhood trying to look at one thing for too long, and inevitable reaching a threshold at which that thing would visually break down and perception deteriorate. This was a game I used to play as a child, playing with attention and distraction, mutating myself into a state of trance or autohypnosis, absorbed, diverted, making myself nebulous. Through early experimentation with my own eyes as a visualization technology, within childhood\u2019s world of the chaos of sensation, I sensed (or discovered) the disconnected nature of reality. This particular technoperceptual habituation might be behind my enduring attunement to simulacra and its disintegrative possibilities. The demons of <i>Charmed</i> are encountered via spell, metabolized, and then disintegrated. They become ephemeral phenomena, which accord with demonological accounts of them as fundamentally mobile creatures.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:AdvanceRig1.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/8/85/AdvanceRig1.png/300px-AdvanceRig1.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"280\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/8/85/AdvanceRig1.png/450px-AdvanceRig1.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/8/85/AdvanceRig1.png/600px-AdvanceRig1.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:AdvanceRig1.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><i>RANDOM / Maya Advance Rigging</i> by Blender Sushi 2012, using Maya, underlying skeleton with IK/FK switch, muscle spline, spline IK, knee lock, and deformable head, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://mayaspiral.blogspot.com/\">https://mayaspiral.blogspot.com</a></div></div></div>\n<p>But perhaps I like <i>Charmed</i> demons mainly because of my preference for <i>past techniques of making species visible</i>, the business of bestiaries. In popular contemporary culture, the demon is an organism from hell, out of history (discontinuous with us). They are uncivilized incarnations of a threatening proximity not of this world. And who knows demons best today? The technical animators, working in VFX Industry, department of creature design. Computer technical animation is an undisciplinary microworld, situated in transnational commercial production for mass culture, where <i>hacker skills are transduced to sensitized transmedia knowledge as they pass from the plane of heuristic techno-methodology to an interpretive plane of composing visual sense or \u201cappeal\u201d.</i> To think of the space of a CG software, I am using Martha Kenney\u2019s definition of microworld, a space where protocols and equipments are standardized to facilitate the emergence and stabilization of new objects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn398_54-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn398-54\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>To get close to a lived texture of nonhuman nonanimal creatureliness, the technical animators have to sense the complexity of synthetic life through modeling (wealth of detail) and rigging (enacting structure). In other words, they need to get skilled at using digital phenomena (calculative abstraction) to create affectively positive encounters (appeal) with analogue body subjects that are irreducible to discrete mathematical states (the audience). This is a form of \u201copen skill\u201d,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn399_55-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn399-55\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> a context-contingent tactically oriented form of understanding or responsiveness. Creature animation defined as such is, essentially, a hacker\u2019s talent.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Rigonfour1.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/c/c8/Rigonfour1.png/300px-Rigonfour1.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/c/c8/Rigonfour1.png/450px-Rigonfour1.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/c/c8/Rigonfour1.png/600px-Rigonfour1.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Rigonfour1.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A simple rigged bipedal character in Maya 2020</div></div></div>\n<p>Following this understanding of technical animation, I want to highlight one of its actual practices as the focal point of interest in this writing, namely <i>rigging</i>. Rigging can be understood as staging and controlling \u201cmovement\u201d within a limited computational structure (the microworld). Rigging is the talent associated with bringing an environment into transformational particularities using itself. It involves movement between the code space of the software environment (structural determination) and techniques they generate in response to that environment (emergent practice). In other words, the givens of computer graphics software are continually reworked in the creative responses CG hackers develop in relation to the microworld with which they interact. Rigging understood as such, is a workaround practice that both traverses and exceeds the stratified data of its microworld.\n</p><p>Rigging almost always involves making a quality of liveliness through movement. That means, technical animators, through designing so-called rigs, have to create an <i>envelopment</i>: a complex form of difference between the <i>analogue</i> (somatic bodily techniques as the source of perceiving movement) and the <i>digital</i> (analytical ways of conceptualizing movement). This envelopment (skin) reduces what is taken as a model to codified tendencies that encourage and prohibit specific forms of movement and action. As such, rigging is a technological site where bodies are dreamed up, reiterated, or developed.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Animal_animation_industry\">Animal animation industry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>In his research on the nature of skill in computer multiplayer games, James Ash suggests that the design of successful video games depends on creating \u201caffective feedback loops between player and game\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn400_56-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn400-56\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> This is a quality of elusivity in the game\u2019s environment and its mode of interaction with the players, which is predicated on management and control of contingency itself. This is achieved by interactively testing the relation between the code space (game) and the somatic space (users). Drawing on Ash\u2019s insights, I would like to ask how affective quality of liveliness are distributed in the assemblages of various human and technical actors that make up rigging? Exploding demons; what kind of animal geography is that? This is a question of a non-living multi-species social subject in a technically mediated world. I follow Eben Kirksey\u2019s indication of the notion of <i>species</i> as a still useful \u201csense-making tool\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn401_57-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn401-57\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> and propose that the demon\u2019s disintegrative body is a form of grasping species with technologies of visualization. In this case, rigging is part of the imagined species that is grasped through enacting (<i>disintegrativity</i> as its morphological characteristics).\n</p><p><i>Enacting</i> is part of the material practice of learning and unlearning what is to be something else. To enact is to express, to collect and compose a part of the reality that needs to be realized and affirmed by the affects. To (re)enact something is a mutated desire to construct the invisible and mobile forces of that thing. Enactment is not just \u201cmaking\u201d, it is part of much larger fantasy practices and realities. The most obvious examples are religion and marketing as two institutions that depend on the enactments of fans (of God or the brand). The new-media fandom (collectivities of fans) venture in a social and collaborative engagement with corporate engineered products. But as Henry Jenkins has argued, this engagement is highly ambiguous.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn402_58-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn402-58\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Technical animators often behave like fans of their own cultural milieu. For instance when the Los Angeles based visual effects company Corridor Crew tells their story of fixing the bad visual effects of the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, they enact a fan-culture by modifying and thus creating a variation. They participate in shaping a techno-cognitive context for engagement with <i>Star Wars</i> that operates the same story (uniform cultural memory) but has an intensity of its own (potential for mutation).<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn403_59-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn403-59\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> As we can see in the case of Corridor Crew, technical animation is always a materially heterogeneous work. The animators don\u2019t sit on their desks, they enact all sorts of materialities. Animators use somatic intelligibility (embodiment) to fuse with their tools and become visual meaning-making machines that mutually embody their creatures. Therefore, the disintegration rig can be thought of as a human-machine enactment of a mixed-up species, a makeshift assemblage of human-demon-machinic agency enacting morphological transformations\u2014bringing demon species into being. Doing demons is a social practice.\n</p><p>The animation industry is a complex set of talents and competencies associated with the distribution and transmission of media affects. Within VFX-intensive storytelling as one of the fastest growing markets of our time,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn404_60-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn404-60\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> animation designers work to create artifacts potent with positively affective responses. The ways in which affect can be manipulated or preempted is a complex and problematic process.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn405_61-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn405-61\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Industrial model of distributed production is coalescence of conflicting agencies, infrastructures, responsibilities, skills, and pleasures where none of them is fully in command.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn406_62-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn406-62\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Animation technologies has evolved alongside the mass entertainment techno-capital market as a semi-disciplinary apparatus and its constituent player: fans, hackers, software developers, corporates, and pirate kingdoms. I prefer to use the term \u201chacker\u201d (disorganized workaround practices) when referring to the talents of technical animators. CG hackers working in each other\u2019s hacks and rigs, through feedbacked assemblages of skill sharing, tutorial videos, screenshots, scripts, help files, shortcuts. The assemblages are made of layers of codes and tools built on each other, nested folders in one\u2019s own computer, named categories by oneself and others, horde of text files and rendered test JPGs, and so on. These are (en-/de-)crypting extended bodies of subjectively constructed through the communal technological fold interpreted as the 3D computer program. An ecology of pragmatic workaround practices that Amit Rai terms \u201ccollective practices of habituation\u201d, which Katie King might call \u201cdistributed embodiments, cognitions, and infrastructures at play\u201d.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Image92.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/9/90/Image92.gif/300px-Image92.gif\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/9/90/Image92.gif 1.5x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Image92.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>FK (forward kinematics) simple one dimensional rigging in Maya 2020, the rotation value of each \u201cjoint\u201d is accumulated through the chain</div></div></div>\n<p>I propose to understand CG hackers and technical artists with their practices of habituation, as craft-intensive. This implies understanding them as intimately connected with a particular microworld, the knowledge of which comes through skilled embodied practice that subsist over longer periods of time.

An artisan\u2019s life and a set of skills that I acquired in my youth, which are still part of my repertoire of know-hows that makes me expressive today.

Then, rigging as a skill can be understood as a form of pre-conceptual practice.

In the example of demon disintegration that I gave earlier, I suggested the presence of zoomorphic figures (demons) as an indication for thinking about rigging as a bundle of the digital (calculative abstraction), the analogue (body appeal), and the nonhuman (zoomorphic physiology). Zoomorphic figures are historically bound with animation technologies. The design and rigging of \u201ccreatures\u201d are part of every visual effects training program and infused in the job description. Disney Animation Studios is the example of critical and commercial success through mastery over anthropomorphized machines. Animation has been a technology of zoomorphic writing.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Automata_and_calligraphy\u2019s_mimetic_figures\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Automata_and_calligraphy.E2.80.99s_mimetic_figures\">Automata and calligraphy\u2019s mimetic figures</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-7\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:DigestingDuck1.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/fe/DigestingDuck1.png/300px-DigestingDuck1.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"231\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/f/fe/DigestingDuck1.png/450px-DigestingDuck1.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/f/fe/DigestingDuck1.png/600px-DigestingDuck1.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:DigestingDuck1.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Engraving of <i>Digesting Duck</i>, an automaton in the form of a duck, created by Jacques de Vaucanson, 1739.

The clockwork animals, those attendant mammalian attachments, were bits of kinematic programming able to produce working simulacrums of a living organism. Perhaps rigging is a manifestation of the desire to produce and study automata. For Golem, that unfortunate unformed limb, the rig was YHWH, the name of the God. Another witness is a variation of calligraphy, the belle-lettre style of enfolding animals into letters, which is as old as writing itself. The particular volumetric regime of making animal shapes with calligraphy operates by confusing pictorial and lexical attributes, mobilizing a sort of wit in order to animate imaginary and real movements. Mixing textuality and figurality is something like a childhood experience. A kind of word-puzzle which uses figurative pictures with alphabetical shapes. It is a game of telescoping language through form, schematizing a space where the animal\u2019s body and language form one gestalt. In my childhood I was indeed put into a calligraphy course, which I eventually opted out of. Although extremely short, my calligraphy training taught me how the world passes through the mechanized, technical, and skillful pressure of the pen, hand, color, paper, and eye as an assemblage. At that time I experienced calligraphy as an entirely uncharismatic technology. Yet I found myself spending endless hours making mimetic figures with writing. I felt how making animals with calligraphy conflates language and image and thus makes it liable to move in many unpredictable directions. The power of the latent, the hidden relationships, the interpretable. A state of multistability that I enjoyed immensely as a child.\n</p><p>Rigging demons as an occasion of contemporary zoomorphic writing technology suggests that the enfoldment of \u201cmorph\u201d (the transformation of an image by computer) and \u201czoon\u201d (nonhuman animals) is both that which nonhumans shape and that which gives shape to nonhumans. Bodies of demons in the software are enveloped with the appropriate rig for a specific transmodification (movement, disintegration, etc). But because of the presence of zoomorphism\u2014like the case of calligraphy\u2014they don\u2019t move as pure presuppositions. In rigging the deformation and movement are always in question.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:TigerCaligraphy1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/fc/TigerCaligraphy1.jpg/300px-TigerCaligraphy1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"242\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/f/fc/TigerCaligraphy1.jpg/450px-TigerCaligraphy1.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/f/fc/TigerCaligraphy1.jpg/600px-TigerCaligraphy1.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:TigerCaligraphy1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Zoomorphic writing, opaque lapis-lazuli based paint and gold on paper, Iran, 12<sup>th</sup> century</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rigging_as_prosthetic_technology\">Rigging as prosthetic technology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-8\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Following an understanding of technical animation habits in terms of their descriptive capacities, or <i>a pre-conceptual craft-intensive zoomorphic writing practice</i>, I would like to enlarge the understanding of rigging as an essentially prosthetic technology. Prosthetics simply means the extended body. They are vivid illustrations of human-technology relations in terms of the body (prosthetics are perhaps the exact opposite of Morton\u2019s hyperobjects). As the philosopher of virtual embodiment, Don Ihde has argued that the extended body signifies itself through the technical mediation. In this sense the body of the technical animator is an extended lived-body, a machine-infused neuro-physical body. Benefiting from a notion of apparatus developed by Karen Barad, namely apparatus understood as a sort of specific physical argument (fixed parts establishing a frame of reference for specifying \u201cposition\u201d),<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn410_66-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn410-66\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> rigging can be thought of as a sort of articulation. We can now ask how rigging, as a specific prosthetic embodiment of the technologically enhanced visualization apparatus, matters to practices of knowing about the world, species, and demons?\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Manual_understanding_abstract_animals\">Manual understanding abstract animals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-9\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>As I have been showing, technical animators are <i>manual understanders</i> of nonhuman cyber-physiology. They have to be good at two things: morphology and its mathematization, or to be more precise, analytic geometry. Analytic geometry is not necessarily Euclidean or rigid body dynamics, because it also covers curved spaces, n-dimensional spaces, volumetric space, phase space, etc. As I was being self-educated in 3D animation, I learned to understand the space of the software as a n-dimensional manifold; X, Y, Z, the dimension of time, of texture, of audio, and so on. The particular way that technical animators look at nonhumans (animal or nonanimal) creates a mode of abstraction that reduces the state of amorphousness (model) to position and structure, like an anatomy, or as I call it, a rig. Less concerned with external resemblance (shading), rigging is particularly busy with building internal homologies. It is a comprehensible order (skeleton) that permits systematic animation, but also allows complexities and accidents to occur.\n</p><p>Homology is a morphological correspondence primarily determined by relative positions and connections. As soon as technical animators start thinking about rigging, they are doing anatomical work, a science of form. They use comparative biological intuition to imagine an isomorphic system of relations. Through building an abstract animal, they respond to the question of morphological correspondence or analogue. They become thinkers of organic folding. Analogue in homological terms means when a part or organ in one assemblage (an imagined animal) is isomorphic (it has the same function) to another part or organ in a different assemblage (virtual microworld). Rig is the analogue of the animal\u2019s body.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:RiggingDan1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/e/e7/RiggingDan1.jpg/300px-RiggingDan1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/e/e7/RiggingDan1.jpg/450px-RiggingDan1.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/e/e7/RiggingDan1.jpg/600px-RiggingDan1.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:RiggingDan1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>In their presentation of the project hosted by The Gnomon Workshop, <i>Weeds: The Making of an Animated Short Film</i>, a group of Disney tech-artists working on a distributed project that they did on their personal time, talk about how they cared for the dandelion in the process of rigging Dan in 3D animation <i>Weeds</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn40_67-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn40-67\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Kevin Hudson, one of the animators, mentions how he started with attention and observation (opening their bodies to a variety of affective states): \u201cThe inspiration for the story came when I was out front of my house pulling weeds that pop up in my lawn. I looked across my driveway at my neighbor\u2019s yard, which was never watered, and the lawn is dead with only a few dying dandelions clinging to the edge of the sidewalk\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn0_68-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn0-68\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> In the talk, we can see how the creation of \u201cappeal\u201d is understood as the creation of \u201ccare\u201d in the animation culture industry. In the making of Dan, the pictorial effect of appeal is done to Dan\u2019s face as the substance of subjective singularity. Faciality as the medium of the anthropomorphic expression of the facial body (for example in <i>Weeds</i> the whole body becomes an expressive face) is one of the main mediums of the animation industry. The artists of Disney draw from understandings of the mammalian-affective structure (face) and technical agencies (rig) to create interactive dramas of psychological bonding.</div></div></div>\n<p>My prosthetic experience with CG affirms with Ihde\u2019s notion of multistability. Technologies are multistable. That means they have unpredictable side-effects and are embeddable in different ways, in different cultures.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn411_69-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn411-69\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> In a world where technologies and humans interactively constitute one another, I find Ihde\u2019s variational methodology quite useful. It simply means that through variations, and not only through epistemic breakdowns, new gestalts can be forefronted. Fan based contents are generated precisely by variational creativity in the multistable plane of consumption. Ihde\u2019s variational approach is to be understood in contrast to the epistemological breakdown as a revelatory means of knowing\u2014when something that had usually been taken for granted, under breakdown conditions, gets revealed in a new way. Following Ihde\u2019s indication, we can think of mechanisms of the production of differences as variations (how something varies, and is not simply breaking down) in the routines of rigging. They are technologies that are both effective and failing, obscuring and making visible the nonhumans that hackers like to realize. Through abstract speculation and variational (craft-intensive) inspection of the mundane technological mediation of monsters, I have been trying to propose a case for the heterogeneous relationships between human beings, the world and for artifacts used for mediation. I have been doing that to think about this question: How do CG hackers <i>make their animals more real</i>? In order to extend my response to that question, and still taking myself as an empirical access point, I will look at my extended being at work with computer graphics and make a case for phantom limbs.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mastery_of_the_phantom_limb\">Mastery of the phantom limb</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-10\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>I like to propose that prosthetic skills are intimately connected to the mastery of the phantom limb. Phantom limb is a technique of cognitive prosthesis, which allows for the creation of artificial limbs. A post-amputation phenomenon, phantom limbs are the sensation of missing limbs. Elizabeth Grosz has discussed the problematic and uncontainable status of the body in biology and psychology, and that the phantasmatically lost limbs are persistently part of our hermeneutic-cultural body. Is the embodiment through technologies, the technoperceptual habituation of the 3D software, a mode of engagement with the <i>body image</i>? Over longer periods of time, mediating technology can become an artificial limb for the subject. It can reach a state of instrumental transparency. That means that through skilled embodied practices the technical animator\u2019s interaction with their microwork achieves an intuitive character, a techno-perceptual bodily self-experience. The n-dimensional space of the animation software becomes part of the condition of one\u2019s access to spatiality. It becomes one\u2019s \u201cbody image\u201d. Simply put, the <i>body image</i> is the picture of our own body which we form in our mind. It is experienced viscerally and is always anatomically fictive and distorted. The concept of <i>body image</i>, coined by psychoanalyst Paul Schilder and neurologist Henry Head is a schema (spatiotemporally structured model) that mediates between the subject\u2019s position and its environment.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:McKayRig1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/c/c9/McKayRig1.jpg/300px-McKayRig1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/c/c9/McKayRig1.jpg/450px-McKayRig1.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/c/c9/McKayRig1.jpg/600px-McKayRig1.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:McKayRig1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Allan McKay\u2019s tutorial on doing disintegration effects.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn39_70-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn39-70\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> McKay is known for the dissemination visual effects that he achieved as the digital artist for the movie <i>Blade: Trinity</i>, 2004.

In Catholic theology to be sanctified involves the ritual of mortification of the flesh. Mortification refers to an act by which an individual or group seeks to put their sinful parts to death. As both an internal and external process, mortification involves exactly the continuity of missing parts (of the soul) with the living parts. Lacan called it \u201cimaginary anatomy\u201d and designated it as part of the genesis of the ego. Grosz makes note of this and further gives the example of a child becoming a subject through the development of its <i>body image</i>, in various libidinal intensities. Sensations are projected onto the world, the world\u2019s vicissitudes are introjected back into the child. The child\u2019s <i>body image</i> gets gradually constructed and invested in stages of libidinal development: The oral stage and the mouth, the anal stage and the anus, and so on. Children\u2019s bodies, like the process of modeling, move from a state of amorphousness to a state of increasing differentiation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn412_72-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn412-72\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Actors learn to constantly use the concept of <i>body image</i>. In an acting group that I was part of in the early 2000s, part of our training was to control and distort the <i>body image</i> at will in order to insinuate real affective states in one\u2019s self. Without naming it as such, we learned how the <i>body image</i> can shrink and expand. How it can give body parts to the outside world and can incorporate external objects. This is a mode of engagement with the phantom limb, in which the subject stimulates a state of possession of the body through external means. This is also the case in music improvisation. Everyone who has improvised with a musical instrument knows that playing music is not merely a technical problem of tool-use. I have been playing <i>setar</i> on and off for 20 years. Setar is a string-based instrument, and like lute it is played with the index finger. I learned it through a tacit and cognitive apprenticeship (not using notation), starting when I was still a teenager. Mastering a musical instrument as such becomes something personal, distributive, and bodily contextual. The strange phenomena of \u201cmood\u201d in playing the setar\u2014which is the key to its mastery\u2014is perhaps part of the difficulty of learning how to play the instrument. Getting into the mood is precisely the libidinal problem of how the instrument becomes psychically invested, how it becomes a cathected part of the <i>body image</i>.\n</p><p>Rigging as the mastery of the phantom limb made sense to my young self. As a shy teenager I was experiencing a discord between my psychical, idealized self-image (<i>body image</i>) and my actual undesired lived-body that felt like a biological imposition. As Grosz has also mentioned, teenagehood is precisely the age for philosophical desire to transcend corporeality and its urges. My relationship with CG technologies can be understood through ambivalent responses within puberty to the threat of inconsistency of the world. I was changing my <i>body image</i> through visualization of phantom limbs. And thus escaping a state of dispossession (a state of freedom from phantoms). This is what I am calling <i>counter dispossession through engagement with the phantom limb</i>. A mode of prosthetic cognitive engagement with phantom limbs, perhaps against what Descartes warned as the deception of the inner senses. I am still attached to the world of unbelievable images, with its own immanent forms of movement. Witches exploding the body schema of the demons.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Demonological_intimacy\">Demonological intimacy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-11\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>What I am proposing here is to make a site of negotiation with the cyberbox of CG spaces, and to recognize rigging as a mode of engagement with such spaces. Rigging is a trajectory-enhancing device, another trajectory of human-nonhuman relational being that happens in the digital interface. If we take CG animation with its often nonhuman-referenced starting-point, and its prosthetic phenomenology as an extended technologically mediated nurturer of zoomorphic bodies, we can ask the following questions. Which species are socialized through machinic agency of rigging practices? What is the body schema of the hacker in CG as a microworld where there is no near or far? What is experienced as their Gestalt? What kind of grasp is automatically localized? What are their phantom limbs? These are all questions of volumetric regimes. In this essay I have been trying to create a site where responses to these inquiries can be constructed and played with, by observing myself playing and giving a bit more specificity to the demons of <i>Charmed</i>. And taking the hints that Grosz and Ihde give, understand myself as to be thinking and acting in the midst of the pervasive proliferation of technoperceptual phantom limbs.\n</p><p>To think of demon vanquishing visual effects as a model of synthesis, implies learning to see old and new forms of confusion, attachment, subjectivity, agency, and embodiment in mass media techno-culture. <i>A postmodern machinic fantasy in which animators are technical computational de-amputators, exploding the guts of demons.</i> This is a supra-reality hybrid craft in digital form that suggests a mode of intimacy with nonhumans ambivalence. In demon rigging technical animation, the demon arrives as an older model of agency to inspire causality. It is a computer-cyberspace machinic intimacy but also demonological. Demonology is not necessarily only an ecclesiastic discourse (related to the church), but a variational practice of empirically verifying hybrid human-animal creatures from long-standing popular conceptions of a shared non-fictive reality. Call it a fandom spin-off of theology. They are part of the vast repertoire of composite and cross-disciplinary network of nonhuman causality and transmedia writing (bestiary).\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:TalismanRig1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/2/28/TalismanRig1.jpg/300px-TalismanRig1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/2/28/TalismanRig1.jpg/450px-TalismanRig1.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/2/28/TalismanRig1.jpg/600px-TalismanRig1.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:TalismanRig1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Talisman in the form of a warship (with the names of the \u201cSeven Sleepers of Ephesus\u201d) signed by Abdul Wahid ibn al-Haji Muhammad Tahir, Indonesia, 1866, Bodleian Library, University of Oxford.

This was done by patterning of scales: the scale of individual attention to particular fringes of one\u2019s own mini experiences, and the scale of the experience of a shared inhabited world. I couldn\u2019t help using \u201cwe\u201d (and \u201cour\u201d) more than once in the essay. The determiner \u201cwe\u201d is a simple magic spell, a transcendental metaphysical charm through which one speaker becomes many. I associated myself with the \u201cwe\u201d, to evoke the possibility of a witnessable scenographic truth-telling, in order to <i>demonstrate</i> (to vanquish and to fabricate simultaneously) a multidimensional microworld of effective rigging in CG, where the social conjoiner of <i>we</i> would matter. Did I evoke <i>Charmed</i> and <i>Corridor Crew</i> as part of this \u201cwe\u201d? And, is \u201cwe\u201d a sympoiesis or an acknowledgment of a true collective difference? Is \u201cwe\u201d always needed to pull back to include alternate knowledge worlds? Like how it is done in soap operas.\n</p><p>Perhaps my relationship with <i>Charmed</i> is like Prue, Phoebe and Piper to their demons, between love and vanquish. I have been using the notion of multistability to think about the relationships that bind humans to virtual explosive demons as their significant \u201cother\u201d (according to <i>Charmed</i>). In <i>Rigging Demons</i>, a digital folktale, I have proposed rigging as a sensory medium (a mode of nearness and appropriation) and as exosomatic practice (prosthetic): extending part of one\u2019s subjectivity beyond the skin through engagements with digital animation technologies as phantom limbs. Every demonic dematerialization in <i>Charmed</i>, every vanquishment, is also a relinquishing\u2014of materializing forces that create a network out of that which this essay is inspired. This text is itself part of the play with the consciousness of technical animator, CG interface, soap opera, my affective involvement (being spellbound to the series), and an unmetabolized speciation in the style of bestiaries. Exploding demons area visceral non-mammalian animality located within a spacetime that is coordinated by commercial entertainment, transmedia writing technologies, zoosemiotic registers, and all sorts of agents that I am part of. I have been trying to propose a variational understanding of the 3D software as an interactive and augmented microworld of objects, beings, zoons and tools for the visualization of multistable cognitions, a form of transnational knowledge work that many agents (market, demons, machines, hackers) are involved in but none is in full control over.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_3\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rigging_Demons&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-12\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn390-46\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn390_46-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Katie King, \u201cA Naturalcultural Collection of Affections: Transdisciplinary Stories of Transmedia Ecologies Learning.\u201d <i>The Scholar &amp; Feminist Online</i> 10, no.3 (2012), <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://sfonline.barnard.edu/feminist-media-theory/a-naturalcultural-collection-of-affections-transdisciplinary-stories-of-transmedia-ecologies-learning/0/\">http://sfonline.barnard.edu/feminist-media-theory/a-naturalcultural-collection-of-affections-transdisciplinary-stories-of-transmedia-ecologies-learning/0/</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn391-47\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn391_47-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Isabelle Stengers, \u201cIntroductory Notes on an Ecology of Practices,\u201d <i>Cultural Studies Review</i> 11, no. 1 (August 2013), <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.5130/csr.v11i1.3459\">https://doi.org/10.5130/csr.v11i1.3459</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn392-48\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn392_48-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Gregory Bateson, <i>Steps to an Ecology of Mind.

We settled for inventorying as a method because we want to give an account of the structural formations conditioning the various cultural artifacts that co-compose 3D polygon \u201cbodies\u201d through scanning, tracking and modeling. With the help of the multi-scalar and collective practice of inventorying, we attempt to think along the agency of these items, hopefully widening their possibilities rather than pre-designing ways of doing that too easily could crystallize into ways of being. Rather than rarefying the items, as would happen through the practice of collecting, or pinning them down, as in the practice of cartography, or rigidly stabilizing them, as might be a risk through the practice of archiving, inventorying is about continuous updates, and keeping items available.\n</p><p>Among all of the apparatuses of the Modern Project that persistently operate on present world orderings, naming and account-giving, we chose the inventory with a critical awareness of its etymological origin. It is remarkably colonial and persistently productivist: inventory is linked to invention, and thereby to discovery and acquisition.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn62_74-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn62-74\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The culture of inventorying remits us to the material origins of commercial and industrial capitalism, and connects it with the contemporary database-based cosmology of techno-colonialist turbo-capitalism. But we\u2019ve learned about the potentials embedded in Modern apparatuses of designation and occupation, and how they can be put to use as long as they are carefully unfolded to allow for active problematization and situated understanding.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn63_75-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn63-75\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In the case of Possible Bodies, it means to keep questioning how artifacts co-habit and co-compose with techno-scientific practices, historically sustained through diverse axes of inequality. We urgently need research practices that go through axes of diversity.\n</p><p>The temporalities for inventorying are discontinuous, and its modes of existence pragmatic: it is about finding ways to collectively specify and take stock, to prepare for eventual replacement, repair or replenishment. Inventorying is a hands-on practice of readying for further use, not one of account-giving for the sake of legitimization. As an \u201conto-epistemological\u201d practice,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn64_76-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn64-76\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> it is as much about recognizing what is there (ontological) as it is about trying to understand (epistemological). Additionally, with its roots in the culture of manufacture, inventorying counts on cultural reflection as well as on action. This is how inventorying as a method links to what we call \u201cdisobedient action-research\u201d, it invokes and invites further remediation that can go from the academic paper to the bug report, from the narrative to the diagrammatic, and from tool mis-use to interface re-design to the dance-floor. It provides us with inscriptions, de-scriptions and re-interpretations of a vocabulary that is developing all along.\n</p><p>For this text, we followed the invitation of Sara Ahmed, \u201cto think how queer politics might involve disorientation, without legislating disorientation as a politics\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn65_77-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn65-77\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> We inventoried three items, <i>Worldsettings for beginners</i>, <i>No Ground</i> and <i>Loops</i>, each related to the politics of dis-orientation. In their own way, these artifacts relate to a world that is becoming oblique, where inside and outside, up and down switch places and where new perspectives become available. The items speak of the mutual constitution of technology and bodies, of matter and semiotics, of nature and culture and how orientation is managed in tools across the technological matrix of representation. The three items allow us to look at tools that represent, track and model \u201cbodies\u201d through diverse cultural means of abstraction, and to convoke their aftermath.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Item_007:_Worldsettings_for_beginners\">Item 007: Worldsettings for beginners</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Dis-orientation_and_its_Aftermath&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<pre>Author(s) of the item: <b>Blender community</b>\nYear: <b>1995</b>\nEntry date: <b>March 2017</b>\nCluster(s) the item belongs to: <b>Dis-orientation</b>\n</pre>\n<blockquote class=\"pull\"><p>If the point of origin changes, the world moves but the body doesn\u2019t.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn66_78-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn66-78\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>In computer graphics and other geometry-related data processing, calculations are based on Cartesian coordinates, that consist of three different dimensional axes: x y and z. In 3D-modelling, this is also referred to as \u201cthe world\u201d.

We tried to experience its process of \u201cworlding\u201d by staying on the cusp of \u201centering\u201d into the software. Keeping a balance between comprehension and confusion, we used the sense of dis-orientation that shifting understandings of the word \u201cworld\u201d created, to gauge what happens when such a heady term is lifted from colloquial language to be re-normalized and re-naturalized in software. In the nauseating semiotic context of 3D modeling, the word \u201cworld\u201d starts to function in another, equally real but abstract space. Through the design of interfaces, the development of software, the writing of manuals and the production of instructional videos, this space is inhabited, used, named, projected and carefully built by its day-to-day users.\n</p><p>In Blender, virtual space is referred to in many ways: the mesh, coordinate system, geometry and finally, \u201cthe world\u201d. Each case denotes a constellation of x, y, z vectors that start from a mathematical point of origin, arbitrarily located in relation to a 3D object and automatically starting from x = 0, y = 0, z = 0. Wherever this point is placed, all other planes, vertices and faces become relative to it and organize around it; the point performs as an \u201corigin\u201d for subsequent trans-formations.\n</p><p>In the coordinate system of linear perspective, the vanishing point produces an illusion of horizon and horizontality, to be perceived by a monocular spectator that marks the center of perception and reproduction. Points of origin do not make such claims of visual stability.\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull\"><p>The origin does not have to be located in the center of the geometry (e.g. mesh). This means that an object can have its origin located on one end of the mesh or even completely outside the mesh.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn67_79-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn67-79\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>There is not just one world in software like Blender. On the contrary, each object has its own point of origin, defining its own local coordinates. These multiple world-declarations are a practical solution for the problem of locally transforming single objects that are placed in a global coordinate system. It allows you to manipulate rotations and translations on a local level and then outsource the positioning to the software that will calculate them in relation to the global coordinates. The multi-perspectives in Blender are possible because in computational reality, \u201cbodies\u201d and objects exist in their own regime of truth that is formulated according to a mathematical standard. Following the same processual logic, the concept of \u201ccontext\u201d in Blender is a mathematical construct, calculated around the world\u2019s origin. Naturalized means of orientation such as verticality and gravity are effects, applied at the moment of rendering.\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull\"><p>Blender is a two-handed program. You need both hands to operate it. This is most obvious when navigating in the 3D View. When you navigate, you are changing your view of the world; you are not changing the world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn68_80-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn68-80\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote> \n<p>The point of origin is where control is literally located. The two-handedness of the representational system indicates a possibility to shift from <i>navigation</i> (vanishing point) into <i>creation</i> (point of origin), using the same coordinate system. The double agency produced by this ability to alternate is only tempered by the fact that it is not possible to take both positions at the same time.\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull\"><p>Each object has an origin point. The location of this point determines where the object is located in 3D space. When an object is selected, a small circle appears, denoting the origin point. The location of the origin point is important when translating, rotating or scaling an object. See Pivot Points for more.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn8_81-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn8-81\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>The second form of control placed at the origin is the 3D manipulator that handles the rotation, translation, and scaling of the object. In this way, the points of origin function as pivots that the worlds are moved around.\n</p><p>An altogether different cluster of world metaphors is at work in the \u201cworld tab\u201d. Firmly re-orienting the virtual back in the direction of the physical, these settings influence how an object is rendered and made to look \u201cnatural\u201d.\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull\"><p>The world environment can emit light, ranging from a single solid color, physical sky model, to arbitrary textures.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn70_82-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn70-82\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>The tab contains settings for adding effects such as mist, stars, and shadows but also \u201cambient occlusion\u201d. The Blender manual explains this as a \u201ctrick that is not physically accurate\u201d, maybe suggesting that the other settings are. The \u201cworld tab\u201d leaves behind all potentials of multiplicity that became available through the computational understanding of \u201cworld\u201d. The world of worlds becomes, there, impossible.\n</p><p>Why not the world? On one hand, the transposition of the word \u201cworld\u201d into Blender functions as a way to imagine a radicaly interconnected multiplicity, and opens up the possibility for political fictions derived from practices such as scaling, displacing, de-centering and/or alternating. On the other hand, through its linkage to (a vocabulary) of control, its world-view stays close to that of actual world domination. Blender operates with two modes of \u201cworld\u201d. One that is accepting of the otherness of the computational object, somehow awkwardly interfacing with it, and another that is about restoring order, back to what is supposedly real. The first mode opens up to a widening of the possible, the second prefers to stick to the plausible, and the probable.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Item_012:_No_Ground\">Item 012: No Ground</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Dis-orientation_and_its_Aftermath&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<pre>Author(s) of the item: <b>mojoDallas, Hito Steyerl</b>\nYear: <b>2008, 2012</b>\nEntry date: <b>5 March 2017</b>\nCluster(s) the item belongs to: <b>Dis-orientation</b>\n</pre>\n<blockquote class=\"pull\"><p>A fall toward objects without reservation, embracing a world of forces and matter, which lacks any original stability and sparks the sudden shock of the open: a freedom that is terrifying, utterly deterritorializing, and always already unknown.

It all appears too imposing, too normative in the humanist sense, too essentialist even. What body compositions share a horizontal base, what entities have the gift of behaving vertically? How do other trajectories affect our semiotic-material conditions of possibility, and hence the very politics that bodies happen to co-compose? How can these perceptual automatism be de-clutched from a long history of domination, of the terrestrial and extraterrestrial wild that is now sneaking into virtual spheres?<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn75_87-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn75-87\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>We suspect that this is due to a twist in the hierarchy between gravitational forces.

It might be necessary to let go of the need for \u201cground\u201d as a defining element for the very existence of the \u201cbody\u201d, though this makes us wonder about the agencies at work in this un-grounded embodiments.

When standing just does not happen due to a lack of context or a lack of ground, even if it is a virtual one, the notion of standpoint does not work anymore. Situation, though, deserves a second thought.\n</p><p>The political landscape of turning people into things and vice-versa recalls the rupture of \u201cknowing subjects\u201d and \u201cknown objects\u201d that Haraway called for after reading the epistemic use of \u201cstandpoint\u201d in Harding,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn78_90-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn78-90\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> which asked for a recognition of the \u201cview from below\u201d of the subjugated: \u201cto see from below is neither easily learned nor unproblematic, even if \u201cwe\u201d \u201cnaturally\u201d inhabit the great underground terrain of subjugated knowledges\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn79_91-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn79-91\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> The emancipatory romanticism of Harding does not work in these virtual renderings. The semiotic-material conditions of possibility that unfold from Steyerl\u2019s above description are conditions without point, either when viewed from standing or from below.\n</p><p>What would be the implication of displacing our operations based on unconsolidated matter that in its looseness asks for eventual anchors of interdependence? How could we transmute the notion of situatedness in order to understand the semiotic-material conditionings of 3D rendered bodies that affect us socially and culturally through multiple managerial worldings?\n</p><p>Here the \u201cbody\u201d is neither static nor falling: it is floating. Here we find that Haraway\u2019s \u201csituatedness\u201d does not match when we try to manage potential vocabularies for the complex forms of worldmaking and its embodiments in the virtual. What can we learn from the conditions of floating that is brought to us by the virtual transduction of the Modern perspective, in order to draft an account-giving apparatus of present presences? How can that account-giving be intersectional with regards to the agencies implied, respectful of the dimensionality of time and aging, and responsible with a political history of groundness?\n</p><p>Floating is the endurance of falling. It seems that in a computed environment, falling is always in some way a floating. There is no ground to fall towards that limits the time of falling, nor is the trajectory of the fall directed by gravity. The trajectory of a floating or persistently falling body is always already unknown.\n</p><p>In the dynamic imagination of the 3D-animation, the ground does not exist before movement is generated, it only appears as an afterthought. Everything seems upside down: the foundation of the figure is deduced, does not pre-exist its movement. Is there actually no foundation, or does it just mean that it appears in every other loop of movement? Without the ground, the represented body can be seen as becoming smaller and if so, that would open the question on dimensionality and scaleability. But being surface-dependent, it is received as moving backwards and forwards: the Modern eye reads one shape that changes places within a territory. Closer, further, higher, lower: the body arranges itself in perspective, but we must attend the differences inherent in that active positioning. The fact that we are dealing with an animatedmoving body implies that the dimension of time is brought into the conversation. Displacement is temporary, with a huge variation in the gradient of time from momentary to persistent.\n</p><p>In most virtual embodiments, the absolute tyranny of the conditions of gravity do not operate. In a physical situation (a situation organized around atoms), falling on verticality is a key trajectory of displacement; falling cannot happen horizontally upon or over stable surfaces. For the fleshy experienced, falling counts on gravity as a force. Falling seems to relate to liquidity or weightlessness, and grounding to solidity and settlement of matters. Heaviness, having weight, is a characteristic of being-in-the-world, or more precisely: of being-on-earth, magnetically enforced. Falling is depending on gravity, but it is also \u2013 as Steyerl explains \u2013 a state of being un-fixed, ungrounded, not as a result of groundbreaking but as an ontological lack of soil, of base. Un-fixed from the ground, or from its representation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn80_92-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn80-92\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Nevertheless, when gravity is computed, it becomes a visual-representational problem, not an absolute one. In the animation, the figure is fixed and sustained by mathematical points of origin \u2013 but to the spectator from earth, the body seems unfixed from its \u201cnatural soil\u201d. Hence, in a computational space, other directions become possible thanks to a flipped order of orientation: the upside-down regime is expanded by others like left-right, North-South and all the diagonal and multi-vortex combinations of them. This difference in space-time opens up the potential for denaturalized movements.\n</p><p>Does falling change when the conditions of verticality, movement and gravity change? Does it depend on a specific axis of these conditions? Is it a motion-based phenomenon, or a static one? Is it a rebellion against the force of gravity, since falling here functions in a mathematical rather than in a magnetic paradigm? And if so, \u201cwho\u201d is the agent of that rebellion?\n</p><p>At minute 01:05, we find a moment where two realities are juxtaposed. For a second, the toe of the figure trespasses the border of its assigned surface, glitching a way out of its position in the world, and bringing with it an idea of a pierceable surface to exist upon... opening it up for an eventual common world.\n</p><p>In the example, the \u201cfeet\u201d of the figure do not touch the \u201cground\u201d. It reminds us that the position of this figure is the result of computation. It hints at how there are rebellious computational semiotic-material conditions of possibility at work. We call them semiotic because they are written, codified, inscribed and formulated (alphanumerically, to start with). We call them material since they imply an ordering, a composition of the world, a structuring of its shapes and behaviors. Both conditions affect the formulation of a \u201cbody\u201d by considering weight, height and distance. They also affect the physicality of computing: processes that generate computing\u2019s pulses in electromagnetic circuits, power network use, server load, etc.\n</p><p>When the computational grid is placed under the feet of the jumping figure, materialities have to be computed, generated and located \u201cback\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d into a \u201cworld\u201d. Only in relation to a fixed point of origin and after having declared its world to make it exist, the surrounding surfaces can be settled. Accuracy would depend on how those elements are placed in relation to the positioned \u201cbody\u201d. But accuracy is a relational practice: body and ground are computed separately, each within their own regime of precision. When the rendering of the movement makes them dependent on the placement of the ground, their related accuracy will appear as strong or weak, and this intensity will define the kind of presence emerging.\n</p><p>Thinking present presences can not rely on the lie of laying. A thought about agency can neither rely on the ground to fall towards nor on the roots of grass that emerge from it. How can we then invoke a politics of floating not on the surface but within, not cornered but around and not over but beyond, in a collective but not as a grass-roots movement? Constitutive conditioning of objects and subjects is absolutely relational, and hence we must think of and operate with their consistencies in a radically relational way: not as autonomous entities but as interdependent worldings. Ground and feet, land and movement, verticality and time, situatedness and axes: the more of them we take into account when giving account of the spheres we share, the more degrees of freedom we are going to endow our deterritorialized and reterritorialized lives with.\n</p><p>The body is a political fiction, one that is alive; but a fiction is not a lie.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn81_93-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn81-93\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> And so are up, down, outside, base, East and South and presence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn82_94-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn82-94\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Nevertheless, we must unfold the insights from knowing how those fictions are built to better understand their radical affection on the composition of what we understand as \u201cliving\u201d, whether that daily experience is mediated, fleshly or virtually.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Item_022:_Loops\">Item 022: Loops</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Dis-orientation_and_its_Aftermath&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<pre>Author(s) of the item: <b>Golan Levin, Merce Cunningham, OpenEnded group, Buckminster Fuller</b>\nYear: <b>2009, 2008, 1971, 1946</b>\nEntry date: <b>November 2016</b>\nCluster(s) the item belongs to: <b>Dis-orientation</b>\n</pre>\n<p><i>Loops</i> entered the Possible Bodies inventory for the first time through an experiment by Golan Levin.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn83_95-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn83-95\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Using an imaging technique called Isosurfacing, common in medical data-visualization and cartography, Levin rendered a motion recording of Cunningham\u2019s performance <i>Loops</i>.

In 2001, they recorded four takes of Cunningham performing <i>Loops</i>, translating the movement of his hands and fingers into a set of datapoints. The idea was to \u201cOpen up Cunningham\u2019s choreography of Loops completely\u201d as a way to test the idea that the preservation of a performance could count as a form of distribution.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn86_98-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn86-98\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The release of the recorded data consists of four compressed folders.

The idea was to explore the maximum number of movement possibilities within the anatomical restrictions of each joint rotation.

He situated the performance in front of <i>Map (Based on Buckminster Fuller\u2019s Dymaxion Airocean World)</i>, a painting by his friend Jasper Johns. Roger Copeland describes <i>Loops</i> as follows: \u201cIn much the same way that Fuller and Johns flatten out the earth with scrupulous objectivity, Cunningham danced in a rootless way that demonstrated no special preference for any one spot\u201d. Later on, in the same book, \u201cConsistent with his determination to decentralize the space of performance, Cunningham\u2019s twitching fingers never seemed to point in any one direction or favor any particular part of the world represented by Johns\u2019s map painting immediately behind him\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn92_104-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn92-104\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In one of the rare images that circulates of the 1971 performance, we see Cunningham with composer Gordon Mumma in the background. From the photograph it is not possible to detect if Cunningham is facing the painting while dancing <i>Loops</i>, and whether the audience was seeing the painting behind or in front of him.\n</p><p>Cunningham met Buckminster Fuller in 1948 at Black Mountain College. In an interview with Jeffrey Schnapp, he describes listening to one of Fuller\u2019s lectures: \u201cIn the beginning you thought, this is absolutely wonderful, but of course it won\u2019t work.

By aligning medical evidence with computational power, biomedical imaging seems to operate at the forefront of technological advancement while remaining all too attached to Modern gestures of cutting, dividing and slicing. Computer tomography actively naturalizes Modern regimes such as Euclidean geometry, discretization, anatomy, ocularity and computational efficiency to create powerful political fictions: invasive imaginations and inventions that provoke the technocratic and scientific truth of so-called bodies. This text is a call for trans*feminist<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn96_108-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn96-108\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> software prototyping, a persistent affirmation of the possibilities for radical experimentation, especially in the hypercomputational context of biomedical imaging.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1._Slice\">1.

Specimen were cut into thin translucent sections and mounted between glass, to maximize their accessible surface area and to be able to slide them more easily under the objective. Microtomography (after \u201ctomos\u201d which means <i>slice</i> in Greek), seems at first sight to be conceptually coherent with contemporary volumetric scanning techniques and computer tomography. But where microtomography produces visual access by physically cutting into specimen, computer tomography promises to stay on the outside. In order to affectively and effectively navigate matter, ocularity has been replaced by digital data-visualisation.\n</p><p>In computer tomography, \u201cslice\u201d stands for a data entity containing total density values acquired from a cross-section of a volume. MRI, PET or CT scanners rotate around matter conglomerates such as human bodies, crime scenes or rocks to continuously probe their consistency with the help of radiation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn97_109-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn97-109\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The acquired data is digitally discrete but spatially and temporally ongoing. Only once turned into data, depths and densities can be cut into slices, and computationally flattened onto a succession of two-dimensional virtual surfaces that are back-projected so that each eventually resembles a contrasted black and white X-ray. Based on the digital cross-sections that are mathematically aligned into a stack, a third dimension can now be reverse-engineered. This volumetric operation blends data acquired at different micro-moments into a homogeneous volume. The computational process of translating matter density into numbers, re-constructing these as stacks of two-dimensional slices and then extrapolating additional planes to re-render three-dimensional volumes, is the basis of most volumetric imaging today.\n</p><p>Tomography emerged from a long-standing techno-scientific exploration that was fueled by the desire to making the invisible insides of bodies visible. It follows the tradition of anatomic experiments into a \u201cnew visual reality\u201d produced by early x-ray imagery.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn98_110-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn98-110\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The slice was a collective invention by many: technologists, tools, users, uses, designers and others tied the increasing availability of computational capacity and to the mathematical theorem of an Austrian mathematician and the standardization of radio-densities.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn99_111-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn99-111\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Demonstrating the human and more-than-human entanglements of techno-scientific streams, the slice invoked multiple pre-established paradigms to provoke an unusual view on and inside of the world. Forty years later, most hospitals in the Global North have MRI and CT scanners operating around the clock.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn100_112-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn100-112\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In the mean time, the slice became involved in the production of multiple truths, as tomography was propagated along the industrial continuum of 3D: from human brain imaging to other influential fields of data-extraction such as mining, border-surveillance, mineralogy, large-scale fishing, entomology and archaeology.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn101_113-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn101-113\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The acceleration produced by the probable jump from flattening x-rays to the third dimension, can hardly be overestimated. This jump is made even more useful because of the alleged \u201cnon-invasive\u201d character of this technique: tomography promises visual access without the violence of dissection. Looking at the insides of a specimen which was traditionally conditioned by its death or by inducing <i>an-aesthesia</i>, does not anymore require physical intervention.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn102_114-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn102-114\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> But the persistence of the cross-cut, the fast assumptions that are made about the non-temporality of the slice, the supposed indexical relation they have to matter, the way math is involved in the re-generation of densities and the location of tissues, all of it makes us wonder about the not-non-invasiveness of the imagination at work in the bio(info)technological tale. Looking is somehow always already an operation.\n</p><p>Tomographic slices necessitate powerful software platforms to be visualized, analyzed, rendered and navigated. We call such platforms \u201cpowerful\u201d because of their extensive (and expensive) computational capacities, but also because of ways they embody authority and truth-making. Software works hard to remove any trace of the presence of the scanning apparatus and of the mattered bodies that were once present inside of it. For slices to behave as a single volume that is scanned at a single instant, they need to be normalized and aligned to then neatly fit in the three orthogonal planes of X, Y and Z. This automated process of \u201cregistration\u201d draws expertise from computer vision, 3D-visualisation and algorithmic data-processing to stack slices in probable ways.\n</p><p>From here on, the slices are aligned with the rigidity of Euclidean geometry, a mathematical paradigm with its own system of truth, a <i>straight</i> truth.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn103_115-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn103-115\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> It relies on a set of axioms or postulates where the x, y and z axes are always parallel, and where all corpo-real volumes are located in the cubic reality of their square angles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn104_116-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn104-116\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> For reasons of efficiency, hardware optimization, path dependency and compatibility, Euclidean geometry has become the un-questionable neutral spatial norm in any software used for volumetric rendering, whether this is gaming, flight planning or geodata processing. But in the case of biomedical imaging, x, y and z axes also conveniently fit the \u201csagittal\u201d, \u201ccoronal\u201d and \u201caxial\u201d planes that were established in anatomical science in the 19th century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn105_117-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn105-117\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> The slices have been made to fit the fiction of medicine as seamlessly, as they have been made to fit the fiction of computation.\n</p><p>Extrapolated along probable axis and obediently registered to the Euclidean perspective, the slices are now ready to be rendered as high-res three dimensional volumes. Two common practices from across the industrial continuum of volumetric imaging are combined for this operation: Ray-tracing and image segmentation. Ray-tracing considers each pixel in each slice as the point of intersection with a ray of light, as if it was projected from a simulated eye and then encountered as a virtual object. \u201cImaging\u201d enters the picture only at the moment of rendering, when the ray-tracing algorithm re-inserts the re-assuring presences of both ocularity and a virtual internal sun. Ray-tracing is a form of algorithmic drawing which makes objects appear on the scene by projecting lines that originate from a single vantage point. It means that every time a volume is rendered, ray-tracing performs D\u00fcrer\u2019s enlightenment classic, <i>Artist drawing a nude with perspective device</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn106_118-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn106-118\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Ray-tracing literally inverses the centralized god-like \u201cvision\u201d of the renaissance artist and turns it into an act of creation.\n</p><p>Image segmentation is the so-called non-invasive digital replacement of dissection. It starts at the boundaries rendered on each slice, assuming that a continuous light area surrounded by a darker one is indexical of the presence of coherent materiality; difference on the other hand signals a border between inside and outside. With the help of partially automatic edge detection algorithms, contrasted areas are demarcated and can subsequently be transformed into synthetic surfaces with the help of a computer graphics algorithm such as Marching Cubes. The resulting mesh- or polygon model can be rendered as continuous three dimensional volumes with unambiguous borders.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn107_119-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn107-119\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> What is important here is that the doings and happenings of tomography literally <i>make</i> invisible insides visible.\n</p><p>From the very beginning of the tomographic process there has been an entanglement at work between computation and anatomy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn108_120-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn108-120\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> For a computer scientist, segmentation is a set of standard techniques used in the field of Computer Vision to algorithmically discern useful bits and pieces of images. When anatomist use the same term, they refer to the process of cutting one part of an organism from another. For radiologists, segmentation means visually discerning anatomical parts. In computer tomography, traditions of math, computation, perspective and anatomy join forces to perform exclusionary boundaries together, identifying tissue types at the level of the single pixels. In the process, invisible insides become readable and eventually writable for further processing. Cut along all-too-probable sets of gestures, dependent on assumptions of medical truth, indexality and profit, slices have collaborated in the transformation of so-called bodies into stable, clearly demarcated volumes that can be operated upon. The making visible that tomography does is the result of a series of generative re-renderings that should be considered as operative themselves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn109_121-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn109-121\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Tomography re-presents matter-conglomerates as continuous, stable entities and contributes strongly to the establishment of coherent materiality and humanness-as-individual-oneness. These picturings create powerful political fictions; imaginations and inventions that provoke the technocratic and scientific truth of so-called bodies.\n</p><p>The processual quantification of matter under such efficient regimes produces predictable outcomes, oriented by industrial concerns that are aligned with pre-established decisions on what counts as pathology or exploitation. What is at stake here is how probable sights of the no-longer-invisible are being framed. So, what implications would it have to let go of the probable, and to try some other ways of making invisible insides visible? What would be an intersectional operation that disobeys anthropo-euro-andro-capable projections? Or: how to otherwise reclaim the worlding of these possible insides?\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure03.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/2/2d/Figure03.jpg/600px-Figure03.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"230\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/2/2d/Figure03.jpg/900px-Figure03.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/2/2d/Figure03.jpg/1200px-Figure03.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure03.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Albrecht D\u00fcrer, \u201cArtist drawing a nude with perspective device\u201d, 1525</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figurex.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/7/74/Figurex.jpg/600px-Figurex.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"319\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/7/74/Figurex.jpg/900px-Figurex.jpg 1.5x, /images/7/74/Figurex.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figurex.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\"Representative CT slices of patient MA (top row) and T1 MRI slices of patient JF (bottom row)\" in Leon Y.

But by persistently asking questions like: who sees, who is seen, and who is allowed to participate in the closed circuit of \u201cseeing\u201d, such modes of critique too easily take the side of the individual subject. Moreover, it is clear that in the context of biomedical informatics, the issue of hegemonic modes of doing is more widely distributed than the problem of the (expert) eye, as will become increasingly clear when we meet our protagonist, the software platform Slicer. It is why we are interested in working through trans*feminist concepts such as entanglement and intra-action as a way to engage with the complicated more-than-oneness that these kinds of techno-ecologies evidently put in practice.\n</p><p>Slicer or or 3D-Slicer is an Open Source software platform for the analysis and visualization of medical images in research environments.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn110_122-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn110-122\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> The platform is auto-framed by its name, an explicit choice to place the work of cutting or dividing in the center; an unapologetic celebration of the geometric norm of contemporary biomedical imaging. Naming a software \u201cSlicer\u201d imports the cut as a naturalized gesture, justifying it as an obvious need to prepare data for scientific objectivity. Figuring the software as \u201cslicer\u201d (like butcher, baker, or doctor) turns it into a performative device by which the violence of that cut is delegated to the software itself. By this delegation, the software puts itself at the service of fitting the already-cut slices to multiple paradigms of <i>straightness</i>, to relentlessly re-render them as visually accessible volumes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn111_123-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn111-123\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> In such an environment, any oblique, deviating, unfinished or <i>queer</i> cut become hard to imagine.\n</p><p>Slicer evolved in the fertile space between scientific research, biomedical imaging and the industry of scanning devices. It sits comfortably in the middle of a booming industry that attempts to seamlessly integrate hardware and software, flesh, bone, radiation, economy, data-processing with the management of it all. In the clinic, such software environments are running on expensive patented radiology hardware, sold by global technology companies such as Philips, Siemens and General Electric. In the high-end commercial context of biomedical imaging, Slicer is one of the few platforms that runs independent of specific devices and can be installed on generic laptops. The software is released under an Open Source license which invites different types of users to study, use, distribute and co-develop the project and its related practices. The project is maintained by a community of medical image computing researchers that take care of technical development, documentation, versioning, testing and the publication of a continuous stream of open access papers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn112_124-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn112-124\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>At several locations in- and around Slicer, users are warned that this software is not intended for clinical use.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn113_125-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn113-125\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> The reason Slicer positions itself so persistently outside the clinic might be a liability issue but seems most of all a way to assert itself as a prototyping environment meant to service the in-between of diagnostic practice and innovative marketable products.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn114_126-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn114-126\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> The consortium managing Slicer draws in millions worth of US medical grants every year, already for more than a decade. Even so, Slicer\u2019s interface comes across as alarmingly amateurish, bloating the screen with a myriad of options and layers that are only vaguely reminiscent of the subdued sleekness of corresponding commercial packages. The all-over-the place impression of Slicer\u2019s interface coincides with its coherent mission to be a prototyping rather than an actual software platform. As a result, its architecture is skeletal and its substance consists almost entirely of extensions, each developed for very different types of biomedical research. Only some of this research concerns actual software development, most of it is aimed at developing algorithms for automating tasks such as anomaly detection or organ segmentation. The ideologies and hegemonies embedded in the components of this (also) collectively-developed-software are again confirmed by the recent adoption of a BSD license which is considered to be the most \u201cbusiness-friendly\u201d Open Source license around.\n</p><p>The development of Slicer is interwoven with two almost simultaneous genealogies of acceleration in biomedical informatics. The first is linked to the influential environment of the Artificial Intelligence labs at MIT. In the late nineties, Slicer emerged there as a tool to demonstrate the potential of intervention planning. From the start, the platform connected the arts and manners of Quantitative Imaging to early experiments in robotic surgery. This origin story binds the non-clinical environment of Slicer tightly to the invasive gestures of the computer-assisted physician.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn115_127-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn115-127\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A second, even more spectacular genealogy, is Slicer\u2019s shared history with the <i>Visible Human Project</i>. In the mid-nineties, as the volume of tomographic data was growing, the American Library of Science felt it necessary to publicly re-confirm the picturings with the visible insides of an actual human body, and to verify that the captured data responded to specifically mattered flesh. While the blurry black and white slices did seem to resemble anatomic structures, how to be sure that the results were actually correct?\n</p><p>A multi-billion dollar project was launched to materially re-enact the computational gesture of tomography onto actual flesh-and-blood bodies. The project started with the acquisition of two \u201cvolunteers\u201d, one convicted white middle-aged male murderer, allegedly seeking repentance through donating his body to science, and a white middle-aged female, donated by her husband. Their corpses where first vertically positioned and scanned, before being horizontally stabilized in clear blue liquid, then frozen, and sewn into four pieces.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn116_128-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn116-128\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Each piece was mounted under a camera, and photographed in a zenithal plane before being scraped down 3 millimeter at a time, to be photographed again. The resulting color photographs where digitized, color-corrected, registered and re-rendered volumetrically in x, y, z planes. Both datasets (the MRI-data and the digitized photographs) where released semi-publicly. These two datasets, informally renamed into \u201cAdam\u201d and \u201cEve\u201d still circulate as default reference material in biomedical imaging, among others in current versions of Slicer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn117_129-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn117-129\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Names affect matter; or better said: naming is always already mattering.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn118_130-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn118-130\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The mediatized process of the Visible Human Project coincided with a big push for accessible imagining software platforms that would offer fly-through 3D anatomical atlases, re-inserting Modern regimes at the intersection of computer science, biomedical science and general education.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn119_131-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn119-131\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> The process produced the need for the development of automatic registration and segmentation algorithms such as the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK), an algorithm that is at the basis of Slicer.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn120_132-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn120-132\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Slicer opens a small window onto the complex and hypercomputational world of biomedical imaging and the way software creates the matter-cultural conditions of possibility that render so-called bodies volumetrically present. It tells stories of interlocking regimes of power which discipline the body; its modes and representations are in a top-to-bottom mode. It shows how these regimes operate through a distributed and naturalized assumption of efficiency that hegemonically reproduces bodies as singular entities that need to be clear and <i>ready</i> in order to be \u201chealed\u201d. But even when we are critical of how Slicer orders both technological innovation and biovalue as an economy,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn121_133-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn121-133\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> its licensing and positioning also create collective conditions for an affirmative cultural critique of software artifacts. We suspect that a F/LOSS environment responsibilizes its community to make sure boundaries do not sit still. Without wanting to suggest that F/LOSS itself produces the conditions for non-hegemonic imaginations, its persistent commitment to transformation is key for radical experiments, and for trans*feminist software prototyping.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:367px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure06.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/d/d5/Figure06.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"365\" height=\"141\" class=\"thumbimage\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure06.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\u201cNot for clinical use\u201d, Slicer v4.10.2 (screenshot)</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure05.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/7/7b/Figure05.png/600px-Figure05.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"309\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/7/7b/Figure05.png 1.5x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure05.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Slicer logo, 2018 and 2021</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure07.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/a/a0/Figure07.jpg/600px-Figure07.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"436\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/a/a0/Figure07.jpg 1.5x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure07.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Torso and Internal Organs of the Visible Human, traverse cut, integrated in Voxel-Man virtual training simulator. 3D-imagery by the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science in Medicine, University of Hamburg, 2001</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure08.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/8/81/Figure08.png/600px-Figure08.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"328\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/8/81/Figure08.png/900px-Figure08.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/8/81/Figure08.png/1200px-Figure08.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure08.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Re-rendered torso including medical equipment.

The Modern Separation Toolkit (MST) contains persistent and culturally aligned modes of euro-andro-able-anthropocentric representation: taxonomy, anatomy, perspective, individual subjecthood, objectivity and many other material-semiotic moves of division. Separation is active on every level in order to isolate the part from the whole, the one from the other and to detach the object from the subject. Modern claims of truth work from the assumption that there is a necessary relation between separability, determinacy and sequentiality; between division, knowledge and representation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn122_134-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn122-134\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The disciplines of Art Theory, History of Science and the Philosophy of Perception exemplify with their individual means the particular gestures of separation in which the complexities of a particular world are haunted and caught by Modern modes to understand, name, transmit and eventually \u201capprehend\u201d these worlds. If in tomography representing is a form of grasping or control, it is evident that we need to attend to the power relations that these cutting practices produce, so we don\u2019t allow them to be completely or definitively naturalized, culturally assumed as evident or given.\n</p><p>The specific mode of separation in contemporary biomedical imaging is the art of computational slicing. Our protagonist Slicer is obviously exposed to and exposing various cuts:\n</p><p><i><b>The subjectivity cut</b></i>: Subjectivity can be understood as a prerequisite for representation, as it assures the presence of a subject responsible for a particular understanding of the world. But with the emergence of Modern subjecthood, of physical and legal persona freed from their environmental attachments and charged with free will and the capacity of judgment, additional representational norms impose themselves, somehow occupying an in-between space of singular and normative subjectivity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn123_135-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn123-135\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> In Slicer, the <i>subjectivity</i> cut is activated by the default choice of volumetric rendering, a two-point perspective where lines of sight come together in a single point, that of the individual viewer. These so-called bodies are reduced to their individual matter constellations, separated from the machinery around them, movable but divorced from their specific rhythms, without attachments or complications and most important of all, with minimal agency. Being and becoming is reduced to the incontestable promise of wholeness-at-the-end-of-the-scanner\u2019s-tunnel.\n</p><p><b><i>The regional cut</i> </b>refers to the techno-scientific phenomena of defining a Region of Interest (ROI), a location of special attention, even if it is as vast as a globe or an atlas. The regional cut supports a focus and a training of the gaze that as a result can habituate itself on a certain area, but only at the expense of not looking at another area.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn124_136-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn124-136\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> In Slicer, the technical definition and subsequent isolation of what is called Region Of Interest operates as a computational upgrading of the decisions behind nineteenth century atlases of anatomy. This interface\u2019s operation presents the target as a cut. It results in a visual slicing of the virtual volume, which then exposes its invisible insides by its straight incisions.\n</p><p><b><i>The demarcation cut</i> </b>relates to the way that the practice of segmentation is present in both historical and contemporary biomedical imaging. Segmentation produces absolute divisions between image areas, organs, shades of gray and bones that obediently follow the anatomical canon. It all works together to give the renderings a sense of mathematical precision and medical evidence. In a nutshell, the process allows us to engineer a non-ambiguous spatial lay-out where each tissue or anatomical structure is identified by a label and a unique color code, all based on a black and white blur.

We discussed the effects of the invention of the slice and the naturalization of its geometric and stratifying paradigms. We interrogated the agencies that altogether compose complex entanglements like our protagonist, Slicer. And in the last section, we listed six different cuts, understanding the act of division as a key Modern gesture that relates knowledge to (mostly visual) representation. Now it is time to apprehend Slicer\u2019s technicity by other means.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn127_139-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn127-139\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>With trans*feminist techno-sciences we have learned that it is necessary to problematize Modern regimes and the impossibilities for life they produce. And that it is possible to do so with what we have at hand. Trans*feminism challenges the ontology of humanity by questioning its separateness from social, economic, material, environmental, aesthetic and historical issues as well as from situated intersections such as race, gender, class, age, ability and species. They also invite us to test an ongoing <i>affirmative ethics</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn128_140-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn128-140\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> in relation to the semiotic-material compositions of what we call \u201cour worldings\u201d. It means to put ourselves at risk by reconsidering the very notion of \u201cus\u201d, assuming the response-ability of being always already entangled with these techno-ecologies which we co-compose by just being-in-the-world.\n</p><p>Maybe Open Source platforms such as Slicer can be environments to render so-called bodies differently. Even if this software is being developed in the particularly tight hegemony of innovation-driven, biomedical research, its F/LOSS licensing conditions invites us to imagine an affirmative critique, in dialogue with the communities that develop the software. Or could the platform itself be rendered differently through disobedient takes on the body?\n</p><p>This text ends with a set of \u201cfeature requests\u201d that challenge the slicedom of Slicer. It is an attempt at starting a kind of trans*feminist prototyping for an open source software platform for biomedical informatics. To technically widen the tomographic imagination, we could maybe start by:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Renaming the software platform to more accurately reflect the operations it performs. Some proposals: <i>Euclidean Anatomix</i>, <i>Forever dissecting</i>, <i>The Slicest</i>, <i>FlashFlesh</i>, <i>A-clinical Suite Pro</i>, <i>Tomographix Toolbox</i>, <i>Final Cut\u2122, Kiss cut and the sensing knife</i>...<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn129_141-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn129-141\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Introducing multiple and relational-perspectives. Computational rendering does not need a single vantage point, nor does it need to mimic the presence of human eyes. Next to the conventional two-way and orthogonal perspective, Slicer could bring multiple-axis and non-Euclidean perspective to the foreground.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn130_142-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn130-142\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>De-centering the ocularcentrism of the renderings and re-orient representations. It is not (necessarily) about replacing vision with touch, vibrational, thermic and aural renderings although they might be less or otherwise burdened by Modern issues. We are first of all wondering about first of all collective modes of sensing and/or observation, to include multiplied modes of gathering and of processing impressions, of involving otherwise enabling renderings of data.</li>\n<li>Breaking the mirage of the interface as a mirror or window on a natural outcome. There must be ways to insist that representation is never complete: in volumetric renderings, nothingness and thereness are happening at the same time. Donna Haraway: \u201cPartiality and not universality is the condition of being heard to make rational knowledge claims.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn131_143-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn131-143\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>De-individualizing the imagery of the oneness of humanness. The platform does not need to technically collapse multiple slices into a discrete, single volumetric object that appear out of nowhere. Katherine Hayles says \u201conly if one thinks of the subject as an autonomous self, independent of the environment, is one likely to experience the panic of Norbert Wiener\u2019s Cybernetics and Bernard Wolfe\u2019s Limbo [...] when the human is seen as part of a distributed system... it is not a question of leaving the body behind but rather of extending embodied awareness in highly specific, local and material ways that would be impossible without electronic prosthesis\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn132_144-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn132-144\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup></li>\n<li>Problematzing the processual temporality of the volumetric images; can we make sure that we do not forget that these volumes as being constructed from takes at different moments, glued into a single object?</li>\n<li>Implementing <i>Agential Regions of Interest</i>. This is aimed at eventually liberating and freeing the slice from the Modern project. What would an a-Modern slice be, how would it behave? How to un-capture the slice from its Modern ghosts?</li>\n<li>Last but not least, we propose to dedicate some of funds to the initiation of a non-dependent program that would allow users, experts and other participants in Slicer to study the Computer Vision (sic) techniques that are implemented in this software. The program should not follow the limited spectrum of probable visions of a white-washed medical research imagination.</li></ul>\n<p>The possible is not about a fantastical widening of the imagination, but it is a technical condition that is already happening. This is a fundamental political twist in cultural analysis and critique of what imagination is: it is actually a technical thing. Imagination depends on the devices we collectively use, or that allow our lives to be used by. The devices we collectively use depend on that imagination. This dependency has always been and will always be <i>mutual</i>. When we assume this condition, then what would response-able imagery entail?\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure13.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/fc/Figure13.jpg/600px-Figure13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"573\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/f/fc/Figure13.jpg/900px-Figure13.jpg 1.5x, /images/f/fc/Figure13.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Figure13.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Lynn Randolph, \u201cImmeasurable Result\u201d, oil on masonite, 1994.

This folder named faces1999 is what computer vision scientists call a dataset, a collection of images to test and train their algorithms. The pictures have all been shot using the same device, a Kodak DC280, a digital camera aimed at the \u201ckeen amateur digital photographer\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn133_145-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn133-145\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> If the Kodak DC280 promised a greater integration of the camera within the digital photographic workflow, it was not entirely seamless and required the collaboration of the photographer at various stages. The camera was shipped with a 20 MB memory card. The folder size is 74.8 MB, nearly four times the card\u2019s storage capacity. The photographs have been taken during various sessions between November 1999 and January 2000 and transferred to a computer to empty the card several times. Additionally, if the writing on the card was automatic, it was not entirely transparent. As product reviewer Phil Askey noted, \u201cOperation is quick, although you\u2019re aware that the camera takes quite a while to write out to the CF card (the activity LED indicates when the camera is writing to the card).\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn134_146-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn134-146\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Moving from one storage volume (the CF card) to another (the researcher\u2019s hard drive), files acquire a new name. A look at the file names in the dataset reveals that the dataset is not a mere dump of the successive shooting sessions. By default, the camera follows a generic naming procedure: the photos\u2019 names are composed of a prefix \u201cdcp_\u201d followed by a five digit identifier padded with zeroes (ie. dcp_0001.jpg, dcp_0002.jpg, etc.). The photographer however took the pain of renaming all the pictures following his own convention, he used the prefix \u201cimage_\u201d and kept the sequential numbering format (ie. image_0001.jpg, image_002.jpg, etc). The photo\u2019s metadata shows that there are gaps between various series of shots and that the folder\u2019s ordering doesn\u2019t correspond to the image\u2019s capture date. It is therefore difficult to say how far the photographer went into the re-ordering of his images. The ordering of the folder has erased the initial ordering of the device, and some images may have been discarded.\n</p><p><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:File_manager_overview.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"File manager overview.png\" src=\"/images/thumb/0/0b/File_manager_overview.png/500px-File_manager_overview.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/0/0b/File_manager_overview.png/750px-File_manager_overview.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/0/0b/File_manager_overview.png/1000px-File_manager_overview.png 2x\" /></a>\n</p><p>The decision to alter the ordering of the photos becomes clearer when observing the preview of the folder on my computer. My file manager displays the photos as a grid, offering me a near comprehensive view of the set. What stands out from the ensemble is the recurrence of the centered frontal face. The photos are ordered by their content, the people they represent. There is a clear articulation between figure and background, a distribution of what the software will need to detect and what it will have to learn to ignore.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn135_147-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn135-147\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> To enforce this division, the creator of the data set has annotated the photographs: in a file attached to the photographs, he provides the coordinates of the faces represented in the photos. This foreground/background division pivoting on the subject\u2019s face relates to what my interlocutors, Femke and Jara whose commentaries and writings are woven within this text, are calling a <i>volumetric regime</i>. This expression in our conversations functions as a sensitizing device to the various operations of naturalized volumetric and spatial techniques. I am refraining from defininge it now and will provisionally use the expression to signal, in this situation, the preponderance of an organising pattern (face versus non-face) implying a planar hierarchy. Simultaneously, this first look at the file manager display generates an opposite sensation: the intuition that other forms of continuity are at play in the data set. This complicates what data is supposed to be and the web of relations it is inserted in.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2._Stitching_with_Hugin\">2. Stitching with Hugin</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Panoramic_Unknowns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The starting point of this text is to explore this intuition: is there a form of spatial trajectory in the data set and how to attend to it? I have already observed that there was a spatial trajectory inherent in the translation of the files from storage volume to another. This volumetric operation had its own temporality (ie. unloading the camera to take more photos), it brought in its own nomenclature (renaming of the files and its re-ordering). The spatial trajectory I am following here is of another nature. It happens when the files are viewed as photographs, and not as merely as arrays of pixels. It is a trajectory that does not follow the salient features the data set is supposed to register, the frontal face. Instead of apprehending the data set as a collection of faces, I set out to follow the trajectory of the photographer through the lab\u2019s maze. <i>Faces1999</i> is not spatially unified, it is the intertwining of several spaces: offices, corridors, patio, kitchen ... more importantly, it conveys a sense of provisional continuity and passage. How to know more about this intuition? How to find a process that sets my thoughts in motion? As a beginning, I am attempting to perform what we call a <i>probe</i> at the Institute for Computational Vandalism: pushing a software slightly outside of its boundaries to gain knowledge about the objects it takes for granted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn136_148-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn136-148\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In an attempt to apprehend the spatial continuum, I introduce the data set\u2019s photographs in an image panorama software called Hugin. I know in advance that using these photos as an input for Hugin will push the boundaries of the software\u2019s requirements. The ideal scenario for software such as Hugin is a collection of photographs taken sequentially and its task is to minimise the distortions produced by changes in the point of view. For Hugin, different photos can be aligned and re-projected on the same plane. The software won\u2019t be able to compensate for the incompleteness of the spatial representation, but I am interested to see what it does with the continuities and contiguities, even as partial as they are. I am interested to follow its process and to see where it guides my eyes.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Composite-hugin-001.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/7/79/Composite-hugin-001.png/500px-Composite-hugin-001.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"391\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/7/79/Composite-hugin-001.png/750px-Composite-hugin-001.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/7/79/Composite-hugin-001.png/1000px-Composite-hugin-001.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Composite-hugin-001.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Two images in Hugin</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Pairing_two_images_in_Hugin.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/0/0d/Pairing_two_images_in_Hugin.png/500px-Pairing_two_images_in_Hugin.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"388\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/0/0d/Pairing_two_images_in_Hugin.png/750px-Pairing_two_images_in_Hugin.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/0/0d/Pairing_two_images_in_Hugin.png/1000px-Pairing_two_images_in_Hugin.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Pairing_two_images_in_Hugin.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Selecting points of interest manually</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"page-break\"></div>\n<p>Hugin can function autonomously and look for the points of interest in the photographs that will allow it to stitch the different views together. It can also let the user select these points of view. For this investigation, the probe is made by a manual selection of the points in the backgrounds of the photos. To select these points, I am forced to look for the visual clues connecting the photos. Little by little, I reconstruct two bookshelves forming a corner. Then, elements in the pictures become eventful. Using posters on the wall, I discover a door opening onto an office with a window with a view onto a patio. Comparing the orientation of the posters, I realize I am looking at different pictures of the same door. I can see a hand, probably of a person sitting in front of a computer. As someone shuts the door, the hand disappears again. One day later, the seat is empty, books have been rearranged on the shelves, stacks of papers have appeared on a desk. In two months, the backgrounds slowly moves, evolves. On the other side of the shelves, there is a big white cupboard with an opening through which one can see a slide projector. Following that direction, is a corridor. The corridor wall is covered with posters announcing computer vision conferences and competitions for students. There is also a selection of photographs representing a pool party that helps me \u201carticulate\u201d several photographs together. Six pictures show men in a pool. Next to these, a large photo of a man laying down on the grass in natural light, and is vaguely reminiscent of an impressionist painting. Workers partying outside of the workplace pictured on the workplace\u2019s walls.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Hugin_trying_to_resolve_different_view_points.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/8/80/Hugin_trying_to_resolve_different_view_points.png/500px-Hugin_trying_to_resolve_different_view_points.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"195\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/8/80/Hugin_trying_to_resolve_different_view_points.png/750px-Hugin_trying_to_resolve_different_view_points.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/8/80/Hugin_trying_to_resolve_different_view_points.png/1000px-Hugin_trying_to_resolve_different_view_points.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Hugin_trying_to_resolve_different_view_points.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Hugin trying to resolve different view points</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Background_prominence.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/0/02/Background_prominence.png/500px-Background_prominence.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"221\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/0/02/Background_prominence.png/750px-Background_prominence.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/0/02/Background_prominence.png/1000px-Background_prominence.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Background_prominence.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Background prominence</div></div></div>\n<p>At regular intervals, I press a button labeled \u201cstitch\u201d in the panorama software and Hugin generates for me a composite image. Hugin does not merely overlay the photos. It attempts to correct the perspectival distortions, smooth out the lighting contrasts, resolve exposure conflicts and blend the overlapping photos. When images are added to the panorama, the frontal faces are gradually faded and the background becomes salient. As a result, the background is transformed. Individual objects loose their legibility, books titles fade. What becomes apparent is the rhythm, the separations and the separators, the partition of space. The material support for classification takes over its content: library labels, colors of covers and book edges become prominent.\n</p><p>Finding a poster in a photo, then seeing it in another photo, this time next to a door knob, then in yet another that is half masked by another poster makes me go through the photos back and forth many times. After a while, my awareness of the limits of the corpus of photos grows. It grows enough to have an incipient sensation of a place out of the fragmentary perceptions. And concomitantly, a sense of the missing pictures, missing from a whole that is nearly tangible. With a sense that their absence can be perhaps compensated. Little by little, a traversal becomes possible for me. Here, however Hugin and I part ways. Hugin gives up on the overwhelming task of resolving all these views into a coherent perspective. Its attempt to recover the contradictory perspectives ends up in a flamboyant spiraling outburst. Whilst Hugin attempts to close the space upon a spherical projection, the tedious work of finding connecting points in the photos gave me another sensation of the space, passage by passage, abandoning the idea of a point of view that would offer an overarching perspective. Like how a blind person touching the contiguous surface can find their way through the maze, I can intuit continuities, contiguities, and spatial proximities that open a volume onto one another. The dataset opens up a world with depth. There is a body circulating in that space, the photos are the product of this circulation.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Spiralling_outburst.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/0/0b/Spiralling_outburst.png/500px-Spiralling_outburst.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"620\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/0/0b/Spiralling_outburst.png/750px-Spiralling_outburst.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/0/0b/Spiralling_outburst.png/1000px-Spiralling_outburst.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Spiralling_outburst.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Spiralling outburst</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Another_spiralling_outburst.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/fc/Another_spiralling_outburst.png/500px-Another_spiralling_outburst.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"510\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/f/fc/Another_spiralling_outburst.png/750px-Another_spiralling_outburst.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/f/fc/Another_spiralling_outburst.png/1000px-Another_spiralling_outburst.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Another_spiralling_outburst.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Spiralling outburst</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"3._Accidental_ethnography\">3.

Fergus 15/02/03\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>As announced in the first line, <i>Faces1999</i> contains pictures of people photographed frontally. The collection contains mainly close-ups of faces. To a lesser degree, it contains photographs of people in medium shots. And to an even less degree, it contains three painted silhouettes of famous actors, like of Buster Keaton. But my trajectory with Hugin, my apprehension of stitches and passages leads me elsewhere than the faces. I am learning to move across the dataset. This movement is not made of a series of discrete steps, each positioning me in front of a face (frontal faces) but a transversal displacement. It teaches me to observe textures and separators, grids, shelves, doors, it brings me into an accidental ethnography of the lab surfaces.\n</p><p>Most of the portraits are taken in the same office environment. In the background, I can see shelves stacked with programming books, walls adorned with a selection of holiday pictures, an office kitchen, several white boards covered with mathematical notations, news boards with invitations to conferences, presentations, parties, and several files extracted from a policy document, a first aid kit next to a box of Nescaf\u00e9, a slide projector locked in a cupboard.\n</p><p>Looking at the books on display on the different shelves, I play with the idea of reconstructing the lab\u2019s software ecosystem. Software for mathematics and statistics: thick volumes of Matlab and Matlab related manuals (like Simulink), general topics like vector calculus, applied functional analysis, signal processing, digital systems engineering, systems programming, concurrent programming, specific algorithms (active contours, face and gesture recognition, the EM algorithm and extensions) or generic ones (a volume on sorting and searching, cognition and neural networks), low level programming languages Turbo C/C++, Visual C++ and Numerical Recipes in C. Heavily implanted in math more than in language. The software ecosystem also includes resources about data visualisation and computer graphics more generally (the display of quantitative information, Claris Draw, Draw 8, OpenGL) as well as office related programmes (MS Office, Microsoft NT). There are various degrees of abstraction on display. Theory and software manuals, journals, introductions to languages and specialized literature on a topic. Book titles ending with the word theory or ending with the word \u201cprogramming\u201d, \u201celementary\u201d or \u201cadvanced\u201d. Design versus recipe. There is a mix of theoretical and applied research. The shelves contain more than software documentation: an electronic components catalogue and a book by John Le Carr\u00e9 are sitting side by side. It Ironically reminds us that science is not made with science only, neither software by code exclusively.\n</p>\n<div class=\"two-columns\">\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Inscriptions.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/6/6a/Inscriptions.jpg/500px-Inscriptions.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/6/6a/Inscriptions.jpg/750px-Inscriptions.jpg 1.5x, /images/6/6a/Inscriptions.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Inscriptions.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Inscriptions</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Inscriptions_2.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/6/67/Inscriptions_2.jpg/500px-Inscriptions_2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/6/67/Inscriptions_2.jpg/750px-Inscriptions_2.jpg 1.5x, /images/6/67/Inscriptions_2.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Inscriptions_2.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Inscriptions</div></div></div>\n</div>\n<p>Books are stacked. Each book claiming its domain. Each shelf adding a new segment to the wall. Continuing my discovery of spatial continuities, I turn my attention to surfaces with a more conjunctive quality. There is a sense of conversation happening in the backgrounds. The backgrounds are densely covered with inscriptions of different sorts. They are also overlaid by commentaries underlying the mixed nature of research activity. Work regulation documents (a summary of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act), staff emails, address directories, a map of the building, invitations to conferences and parties, job ads, administrative announcements, a calendar page for October 1999, all suggest that more than code and mathematics are happening in this environment. These surfaces are calling their readers out: bureaucratic injunctions, interpellations, invitations using the language of advertising. On a door, a sign reads \u201cPlease do not disturb\u201d. A note signed Jean-Yves insists \u201cPlease do NOT put your fingers on the screen. Thanks.\u201d There are networks of colleagues in the lab and beyond. These signs are testament to activities they try to regulate: people open doors uninvited and show each other things on screens leaving finger traces. But the sense of intertwining of the ongoing social activity and the work of knowledge production is nowhere more present than in the picture of a whiteboard where complex mathematical equations cohabit with a note partially masked by a frontal face: Sony Call Ma... your car is \u2026 553-1. The same surface of inscription is used for both sketching the outline of an idea and internal communication.\n</p><p>Approaching the dataset this way offers an alternative reading of the manners in which this lab of computer vision represents itself and to others what its work consists of. The emic narrative doesn\u2019t offer a mere definition of the members activity. It comes with its own continuities. One such continuity is the dataset\u2019s temporal inscription into a narrative of technical progress that results in a comparison with the current development of technology. I realize the difficulty to resist it. How much I myself mentally comparei the Kodak camera to the devices I am using. I take most of m Griffin y photos with a phone. My phone\u2019s memory card is 10 gigabytes whereas Kodak proudly advertised a 20MB card for its DC280 model. The dataset\u2019s size pales in comparison to current standards (a state-of-the-art dataset as UMDFaces includes 367,000 face annotations<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn137_149-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn137-149\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> and VGGFace2 provides 3,3 million face images downloaded from Google Image Search)\u2060.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn138_150-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn138-150\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The question of progress here is problematic in that it tells a story of continuity that is recurrent in books, manuals and blogs related to AI and machine learning. This story can be sketched as: \u201cBack in the days, hardware was limited, data was limited, then came the data explosion and now we can make neural networks properly.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn139_151-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn139-151\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Whilst this narrative is not inherently baseless, it makes it difficult to attend to the specificity of what this dataset is and how it relates to larger networks of operation. And what can be learned from it. In a narrative of progress, it is defined by what it is no longer (it is not defined by the scarcity of the digital photograph anymore) and by what it will become (<i>faces1999</i> is like a contemporary dataset, but smaller). The dataset is understood through a simple narrative of volumetric evolution where the exponential increase of storage volumes rhymes with technological improvement. Then it is easy to be caught in a discourse that treats the form of its photographic elaboration as an in-between. Already digital but not yet networked, post-analogue but pre-Flickr.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"4._Photography_and_its_regular_objects\">4. Photography and its regular objects</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Panoramic_Unknowns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>So how to attend to its photographic elaboration? What are the devices and the organisation of labour necessary to produce such a thing as <i>Faces1999</i>? The photographic practice of the Caltech engineers matters more than it may seem. Photography in a dataset such as this is a leveler. It is the device through whichdisparate fragments that make up the visual world can be compared. Photography is used as a tool for representation and as a tool to regularise data objects. The regularization of scientific objects opens the door to the representation and naturalization of cultural choices. It is representationally active. It involves the encoding of gender binaries, racial sorting, spatial delineation (what happens indoors and outdoors in the dataset). Who takes the photo, who is the subject? Who is included and who is excluded? The photographer is a member of the community. In some way, <i>he</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn140_152-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn140-152\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  is the measure of the dataset. It is a dataset at his scale. To move through the dataset is to move through his spatial scale, his surroundings. Where he can easily move and recruit people, he has bonds with the \u201csubjects\u201d. He can ask them \u201ccome with me\u201d, \u201cplease smile\u201d to gather facial expressions. Following the photographer, we move from the lab to the family circle. About fifty photos interspersed with the lab photos represent relatives of the researchers in their interior spaces. While it is difficult to say for certain how close they are, they depict women and children in a house interior. It is his world, ready to offer itself to his camera.\n</p><p>Further, to use Karen Barad\u2019s vocabulary, the regularization performs an agential cut\u2060: it enacts entities with agency and by doing so, it enforces a division of labor.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn141_153-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn141-153\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> My characterization of the photographer and <i>his</i> subject has until now has remained narrow. The subjects do not simply respond to the photographer, but they respond to an assemblage comprising at a minimum the photographer, camera, familiar space, lighting condition, and storage volumes. To take a photo means more a than a transaction between a person seeing and a person seen. Proximity here does not translate smoothly to intimacy. In some sense, to regularize his objects, as a photographer, the dataset maker must be like everyone else. The photograph must be at some level interchangeable with those of the \u201cregular photographer\u201d. The procedure to acquire the photographs of <i>faces1999</i> is not defined. Yet regularization and normalization are at work. The regulative and normalizing functions of the digital camera, its ability to adapt, its distribution of competences, its segmentation of space are operating. But also its conventions, its acceptability. The photographic device here works as a soft ruler that adjusts to the fluctuating contours of the objects it measures.\n</p><p>Its objects are not simply the faces of the people in front of the photographer. The dataset maker\u2019s priority is not to ensure indexicality. He is less seeking to represent the faces as if they were things \u201cout there\u201d in the world than trying to model a form of mediation. The approach of the <i>faces1999</i> researchers is not one of direct mediation where the camera simply is considered a transparent window to the world. If it were the case, the researchers would have removed all the \u201cartefactual\u201d photographs wherein the mediation of the camera is explicit: where the camera blurs or outright cancels the representation of the frontal face. What it models instead is an average photographic output. It does not model the frontal face, it models the frontal face as mediated by the practice of amateur photography. In this sense, it bears little relation with the tradition of scientific photography that seeks to transparently address its object. To capture the frontal face as mediated by vernacular photography, the computer scientist doesn\u2019t need to work hard to remove the artifactuality of its representation. He needs to work as little as possible, he needs to let himself guided by a practice external to his field, to let vernacular photography infiltrate his discipline.\n</p>\n<div class=\"two-columns\">\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Backlighting.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/f2/Backlighting.jpg/500px-Backlighting.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/f/f2/Backlighting.jpg/750px-Backlighting.jpg 1.5x, /images/f/f2/Backlighting.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Backlighting.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Backlighting</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:502px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Overexposed.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/b/b5/Overexposed.jpg/500px-Overexposed.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/b/b5/Overexposed.jpg/750px-Overexposed.jpg 1.5x, /images/b/b5/Overexposed.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Overexposed.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Overexposed</div></div></div>\n</div>\n<p>The dataset maker internalizes a common photographic practice. For this, he must be a particular kind of functionary of the camera as Flusser would have it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn143_154-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn143-154\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> He needs to produce a certain level of entropy in the program of the camera. The camera\u2019s presets are determined to produce predictable photographs. The use of the flash, the speed, the aperture are controlled by the camera to keep the result within certain aesthetics norms. The regularization therefore implies a certain dance with the kind of behavior the photographer is expected to adopt. If the dataset maker doesn\u2019t interfere with the regulatory functions of the camera, the device may well regularize too much of the dataset and therefore move away from the variations that one can find in amateur photo albums. The dataset maker must therefore trick the camera to make enough \u201cbad\u201d photos as would normally happen over the course of a long period of shooting. The flash must not fire at times even when the visibility in the foreground is low. This requires the circumvention of the default camera behavior in order to provoke an accident bound to happen over time. A certain amount of photos must be taken with the subject off-centre. Faces must be occasionally out of focus. And when an accident happens by chance, it is kept in the dataset. However, these accidents cannot exceed a certain threshold: images need to remain generic. The dataset maker explores the thin range of variation in the camera\u2019s default mode that corresponds to the mainstream use of the device. The researcher does not systematically explore all the parameters. They introduce a certain wavering in its regularities. A measured amount of bumps and lumps. A homeopathic dose of accidents. At each moment, there is a perspective, a trajectory that inflects the way the image is taken. It is never only a representation, it always anticipates variations and redundancies, it always anticipates its ultimate stabilization as data. The identification of exceptions and the inclusion of accidents is part of the elaboration of the rules. The dataset maker cannot afford to forget that the software does not need to learn to detect faces in the abstract. It needs to learn to detect faces as they are made visible within a specific practice of photography and internalized to some degree by the camera.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"5._Volumetric_regimes\">5. Volumetric regimes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Panoramic_Unknowns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-6\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Everything I have written until now has been the result of several hours of looking at the <i>faces1999</i> images. I have done it through various means. In a photo gallery, through an Exif reader program, via custom code, and through the panorama software Hugin. However, nowhere in the README or the website where the dataset can be downloaded, can an explicit invitation to look at the photos be found. The README refers to one particular use. The areas of interest compiled in the Matlab file makes clear that the privileged access to the dataset is through programs that treat the images as matrices of numbers and process them as such. It doesn\u2019t mean a dataset such as <i>faces1999</i> cannot be treated as an object to be investigated visually. Twenty-seven faces is an amount that one person can process without too much trouble. One can easily differentiate them and remember most of them. For the photographer and the person who annotated the dataset, traced the bounding boxes around the faces, the sense of familiarity was even stronger. They were workmates or even family. The dataset maker could be present at all stages in the creation of the dataset: he would select the people, the backgrounds, press the shutter, assemble and rename the pictures, trace the bounding boxes, write the readme, compress the files and upload them on the website. Even if Hugin could not satisfactorily resolve the juxtaposition of points of view, its failure still hinted at a potential panorama ensuring, a continuity through the various takes. There was at least a possibility of an overview, of grasping a totality.\n</p><p>This takes me back to the question of <i>faces1999</i>\u2019s place in a narrative of technological progress. In such narrative, it plays a minor role and should be forgotten. It is not a standard reference of the field and its size pales in comparison to current standards. However, my aim with this text is to insist that datasets in computer vision should not be treated as mere collections of data points or representations that can be simply compared quantitatively. They articulate different dimensions and distances. If the photos cut the lab into pieces, to assemble <i>faces1999</i> implies a potential stitching of these fragments. This created various virtual pathways through the collection that mobilized conjunctive surfaces, walls covered of instructions and recursive openings (door opening on an office with a window opening on a patio). There were passageways connecting the lab to the home and back. There was cohesion if not coherence. At the invitation of Jara and Femke, taking the idea of a volumetric regime as a device to think together the sequencing of points of views, the naturalization of the opposition between face and background, the segmentations, but also the stitches, the passageways, the conjunctive surfaces, the storage volumes (of the brand new digital camera and the compressed archive) through which the dataset is distributed, I have words to apprehend better the singularity of <i>faces1999</i>. <i>Faces1999</i> is not a small version of a contemporary dataset. A quantitative change reaches out into other dimensions, another space, another coherence, another division of labour and another photographic practice. Another volumetric regime.\n</p><p>Acknowledging its singularity does not mean to turn <i>faces1999</i> into a nostalgic icon. It matters because recognizing its volumetric regime changes the questions that can be asked of current datasets. Instead of asking how large they are, how much they have evolved, I may be asking to which volumetric regime they belong (and they help enact in return). Which means a flurry of new questions need to be raised: what are the dataset\u2019s passageways? How do they split and stitch? What are its conjunctive surfaces? What is the division of labour that subtends it? How is the photographic apparatus involved in the regularization of their objects? And what counts as photographic apparatus in this operation?\n</p><p>Asking these questions to datasets such as MegaFace, Labelled Faces in the wild or Google facial expression comparison would immediately signal a different volumetric regime that cannot be reduced to a quantitative increase. The computer scientist once amateur photographer becomes photo-curator (the photos are sourced from search engines rather than produced by the dataset maker). The conjunctive surfaces that connect administrative guidelines and mathematical formulas would not be represented in the photos backgrounds but built into the contract and transactions of the platform of annotation that recruits the thousands of workers necessary to label the images (instead of the lone packager of <i>faces1999</i>). Their passageways should not be sought in the depicted spaces in which the faces appear, but in the itineraries that these photos have followed online. And however we would like to qualify their cohesion if not coherence, we should not look for a panorama, even incomplete and fragmented, but for other modes of stitching and splitting, of combining their storage volumes and conjunctive surfaces.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_6\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Panoramic_Unknowns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-7\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn133-145\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn133_145-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Phil Askey, \u201cKodak DC280 Review,\u201d DPReview, accessed November 19, 2020.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn134-146\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn134_146-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Askey, \u201cKodak DC280 Review,\u201d 6.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn135-147\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn135_147-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">In an article related to the dataset Caltech 256, Pietro Perona, pictured in <i>faces1999</i>, uses the word <i>clutter</i> to describe what is not the main object of the photo.

In legal court, the norm is anthropocentric, but when it comes to representation\u2026\n</p><p><b>Femke Snelting</b>: This is the subject of \u201cKritios They\u201d?\n</p><p><b>Simone C Niquille</b>: Kritios They is a character in <i>The Fragility of Life</i>, a result of the research project <i>The Contents</i>. While <i>The Contents</i> is based on the assumption that we as humans possess and create content, living in our daily networked space of appearance that is used for or against us, I became interested in the corporeal fragility exposed and created through this data, or that the data itself possesses. In the film, the decimation scene questions this quite bluntly: when does a form stop being human, when do we lose empathy towards the representation? Merely reducing the 3D mesh\u2019s resolution, decreasing its information density, can affect the viewer\u2019s empathy. Suddenly the mesh might no longer be perceived as human, and is revealed as a simple geometric construct: A plain surface onto which any and all interpretation can be projected. The contemporary accelerating frenzy of collecting as much data as possible on one single individual to achieve maximum transparency and construct a \u201cfleshed out\u201d profile is a fragile endeavor. More information does not necessarily lead to a more defined image. In the case of Kritios They, I was interested in character creation software and the parameters embedded in its interfaces. The parameters come with limitations: an arm can only be this long, skin color is represented within a specified spectrum, and so on. How were these decisions made and these parameters determined? Looking at design history and the field\u2019s striving to create a standardized body to better cater to the human form, I found similarities of intent and problematics.\n</p><p>Anthropometric efforts ranging from Da Vinci\u2019s <i>Vitruvian Man</i>, to Corbusier\u2019s <i>Modulor</i>, to Alphonse Bertillon\u2019s <i>Signaletic Instructions</i> and invention of the mug shot, to Henry Dreyfuss\u2019s <i>Humanscale</i>\u2026 What these projects share is an attempt to translate the human body into numbers.

It originated as assembly-based 3D modeling research carried out at Stanford University. The Fuse interface segments the body into Frankenstein-like parts to be assembled by the user. However, the seemingly restriction free Lego-character-design interface is littered with limitations. Not all body parts mix as well as others; some create uncanny folds and seams when assembled. The torso has to be a certain length and the legs positioned in a certain way and when I try to adapt these elements the automatic rigging process doesn\u2019t work because the mesh won\u2019t be recognized as a body.\n</p><p>A lot of these processes and workflows demand content that is very specific to their definition of the human form in order to function. As a result, they don\u2019t account for anything that diverges from that norm, establishing a parametric truth that is biased and discriminatory. This raises the question of what that norm is and how, by whom and for whom it has been defined.\n</p><p><b>FS</b>: Could you say something about the notion of \u201cparametric truth\u201d that you use?\n</p><p><b>SN</b>: Realizing the existence of a built-in anthropometric standard in such software, I started looking at use cases of motion capture and 3D scanning in areas other than entertainment \u2014 applications that demand an objectivity. I was particularly interested in crime and accident reconstruction animations that are produced as visual evidence or in court support material. Traditionally this support material would consist of photographs, diagrams and objects. More recently this sometimes includes forensic animations commissioned by either party. The animations are produced with various software and tools, sometimes including motion capture and/or 3D scanning technologies.\n</p><p>These animations are created post-fact; a varying amalgam of witness testimonies, crime scene survey data, police and medical reports etc. Effectively creating a \u201dversion of\u201d, rather than an objective illustration. One highly problematic instance was an animation intended as a piece of evidence in the trial of George Zimmerman on the charge of second-degree murder on account of the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Zimmerman\u2019s defense commissioned an animation to attest his actions as self defense. Among the online documentation of the trial is a roughly two-hour long video of Zimmerman\u2019s attorney questioning the animator on his process. Within these two hours of questioning, the defense attorney is attempting to demonstrate the animations\u2019 objectivity by minutely scrutinizing the creation process. It is revealed that a motion capture suit was used to capture the character\u2019s animations, to digitally re-enact Zimmerman and Martin. The animator states that he was the one wearing the motion capture suit portraying both Zimmerman as well as Martin. If this weren\u2019t already enough to debunk an objectivity claim, the attorney asks: \u201cHow does the computer know that it is recording a body?\u201d Upon which the animator responds: \u201cYou place the sixteen sensors on the body and then on screen you see the body move in accordance.\u201d But what is on screen is merely a representation of the data transmitted by 16 sensors, not a body.\n</p><p>A misplaced or wrongly calibrated sensor would yield an entirely different animation. And further, the anthropometric measurements of the two subjects were added in post production, after the animation data had been recorded from the animator\u2019s re-enactment. In this case the animation was thankfully not allowed as a piece of evidence, but it nevertheless was allowed to be screened during the trial. The difference from showing video in court is, seeing something play out visually, in a medium that we are used to consume. It takes root in a different part of your memory than a verbal acount and renders one version more visible than others. Even with part of the animation based on data collected at the crime scene, a part of the reproduction will remain approximation and assumption.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:09_newsdirect.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/6/6d/09_newsdirect.png/600px-09_newsdirect.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/6/6d/09_newsdirect.png/900px-09_newsdirect.png 1.5x, /images/6/6d/09_newsdirect.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:09_newsdirect.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>3D animation by Reuter\u2019s owned News Direct \u201cTransform your News with 3D Graphics\u201d, \u201cFBI investigates George Zimmerman for shooting of Florida teen, Trayvon Martin\u201d, <i>News Direct</i>, 2012</div></div></div>\n<p>This is visible in the visual choices of the animation, for example. Most parts are modeled with minimal detail (I assume to communicate objectivity). \u201cThere were no superfluous aesthetic choices made.\u201d However, some elements receive very selective and intentional detailing. The crime scene\u2019s grassy ground is depicted as a flat plane with an added photographic texture of grass rather than 3D grass produced with particle hair. On the other hand, Zimmerman and Martin\u2019s skin color is clearly accentuated as well as the hoodie worn by Trayvon Martin, a crucial piece of the defense\u2019s case. The hoodie was instrumentalized as evidence of violent intentions during the trial, where it was claimed that if Martin had not worn the hood up he would not have been perceived as a threat by Zimmerman. To model these elements at varying subjective resolution was a deliberate choice. It could have depicted raw armatures instead of textured figures, for example. The animation was designed to focus on specific elements; shifting that focus would produce differing versions.\n</p><p><b>FS</b>: This is something that fascinates me, the different levels of detailing that occur in the high octane world of 3D. Where some elements receive an enormous amount of attention and other elements, such as the skeleton or the genitals, almost none.\n</p><p><b>SN</b>: Yes, like the sixteen sensors representing a body\u2026\n</p><p><b>FS</b>: Where do you locate these different levels of resolution?\n</p><p><b>SN</b>: Within the CGI [computer-generated imagery] community, modelers are obsessed by creating 3D renders in the highest possible resolution as a technical as well as artistic accomplishment, but also as a form of muscle flexing of computing power. Detail is not merely a question of the render quality, but equally importantly it can be the realism achieved; a tear on a cheek, a thin film of sweat on the skin. On forums you come across discussions on something called subsurface scattering,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn147_158-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn147-158\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> which is used to simulate blood vessels under the skin to make it look more realistic, to add weight and life to the hollow 3D mesh. However, the discussions tend to focus on pristine young white skin, oblivious to diversity.\n</p><p><b>JR</b>: This raises the notion of the \u201cepistemic object\u201d. The matter you manipulated brings a question to a specific table, but it cannot be on every table: it cannot be on the \u201ctechies\u201d table <i>and</i> on the designers table. However, under certain conditions, with a specific language and political agenda and so on, <i>The Contents</i> raises certain issues and serves as a starting point for a conversation or facilitates an argument for a conversation. This is where I find your work extremely interesting. I consider what you make objects around which to formulate a thought, for thinking about specific crossroads. They can as such be considered a part of \u201cdisobedient action-research\u201d, as epistemic objects in the sense that they make me think, help me wonder about political urgencies, techno-ecological systems and the decisions that went into them.\n</p><p><b>SN</b>: That\u2019s specifically what two scenes in the film experiment with: the sleeping shadow and the decimating mug shot. They depend on the viewer\u2019s expectations. The most beautiful reaction to the decimating mug shot scene has been: \u201cWhy does it suddenly look so scary?\u201d\n</p><p>The viewer has an expectation in the image that is slowly taken away, quite literally, by lowering the resolution. Similar with the sleeping scene: What appears as a sleeping figure filmed through frosted glass unveils itself by changing the camera angle. The new perspective reveals another reality. What I am trying to figure out now is how the images operate in different spaces. Probably there isn\u2019t one single application, but they can be in <i>The Fragility of Life</i> as well as in a music video or an ergonomic simulation, for example, and travel through different media and contexts. I am interested in how these images exist in these different spaces.\n</p><p><b>FS</b>: We see that these renderings, not only yours but in general, are very volatile in their ability to transgress applications, on the large scale of movements ranging from Hollywood to medical, to gaming, to military. But it seems that, seeing your work, this transgression can also function on different levels.\n</p><p><b>SN</b>: These different industries share software and tools, which are after all developed within their crossroads. Creating images that attempt to transgress levels of application is a way for me to reverse the tangent, and question the tools of production.\n</p><p>Is the image produced differently if the tool is the same or is its application different? If 3D modeling software created by the gaming industry were used to create forensic animations, possibly incarcerating people, what are the parameters under which that software operates? This is a vital question affecting real lives.\n</p><p><b>JR</b>: Can you please introduce us to Mr. #0082a?\n</p><p><b>SN</b>: In attempting to find answers to some of the questions on the Fuse character creator software\u2019s parameters I came across a research project initiated by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory from the late 1990s and early 2000s called \u201cCAESAR\u201d [Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource].\n</p><p>#0082a is a whole body scan mesh from the CAESAR database,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn148_159-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn148-159\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> presumably the 82nd scanned subject in position a. The CAESAR project\u2019s aim was to create a new anthropometric surface database of body measurements for the Air Force\u2019s cockpit and uniform design. The new database was necessary to represent the contemporary U.S. military staff. Previous measurements were outdated as the U.S. population had grown more diverse since the last measurement standards had been registered. This large-scale project consisted of scanning about 2000 bodies in the United States, Italy and the Netherlands. A dedicated team travelled to various cities within these countries outfitted with the first whole body scanner developed specifically for this purpose by a company called Cyberware. This is how I initially found out about the CAESAR database, by trying to find information on the Cyberware scanner.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Simone1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/c/c8/Simone1.jpg/600px-Simone1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/c/c8/Simone1.jpg/900px-Simone1.jpg 1.5x, /images/c/c8/Simone1.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Simone1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Leonard Nimoy is one of the first actors to get scanned and be replicated digitally in <i>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</i> [\u2026] Image: Cinefex 29, 02/1987</div></div></div>\n<p>I found a video somewhere deep within YouTube, it was this very strange and wonderful video of a 3D figure dancing on a NIST [U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology] logo.

A very limited amount of training data, that in the case of Fuse ended up becoming a widely distributed commercial software. At least at this point the training data should be reviewed\u2026 It felt like a whole ecology of past and future 3D anthropometric standards revealed itself through this one mesh.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_7\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=The_Fragility_of_Life&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn144-155\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn144_155-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Another aspect of the <i>Hairy Hominid effect</i> appears in our conversation with Phil Langley, \u201cWe hardly encounter anything that didn\u2019t matter,\u201d in this chapter.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn145-156\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn145_156-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">William M.

Through an examination of two games about the Beirut war, that differ in their approach, the text examines the possibilities of opening up a space for the Other in the gap between simulation as rehearsal versus that of training.\n</p><p>History is apparently no longer sufficient to uphold the dominance of the western viewpoint. It must be overcome, but despite the prevalence of critical tools such as discourse analysis, genealogy archaeology and other methods that attempt to dismantle the totalitarian universal structure of history, it is simulation that appears to disassemble it, only to take its place. However, to overcome history through simulation is to root the colonized into a past of prediction, efficiency and closed repetition. Simulation studies people and places like Beirut and their wars as strategy, in order to lock them into a position that is not indigenous to their way of being, that of errantry.\n</p><p>\u00c9douard Glissant describes errantry as \u201crooted movement\u201d in a sense that it\u2019s a desire to go against the root where the root is the historical beginnings and universalization of the western point of view.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn1_161-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn1-161\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The history of the West has always been tied to fixed states of nationality, an idea that has been exported to the colonized nations like Lebanon, that have come to aspire to similar univocal rootedness. The idea of errantry, which Glissant believes to be native to the colonized, is a fluid subjectivity that sits between the notion of identity and movement.\n</p><p>In other words, what this text will put forward, is that simulation closes in on the possibilities of what Glissant describes as a poetics, creating a continuous longing for the lost but defunct and deconstructed stories of origins and history that are tied to the west. In order to foreclose on the pasts war like the one of Beirut in 1982, simulation engines use remote sensing and computer-generated images to build model worlds in order to programmatically train on different scenarios, from different perspectives across different surfaces of the earth. Simulation becomes a device to train actions and access history in a world of greater perceived uncertainly, automation, deregulation and the supposed \u201cneed\u201d for risk management.\n</p><p>I need not reiterate the pages and pages written on the prominence of economics-based calculation and prediction of events that have taken over from poetry, storytelling and meaning; the decreasing importance of a stable and single point of view which is being supplemented (and often replaced) by multiple perspectives, overlapping windows, distorted flight lines, and divergent vanishing points. Farewell to History which should have long been replaced by genealogy, archaeology, discourse analysis and the evolutionary vibrations of matter, geology and exploding events, exploding long before history, contingency and accidents bubbling beneath the crust. A loss that is felt even more prominently these days with the constant interruption of screen face-to-face conversations by glitches, echoes, ventilation hum, or simply by headaches and sore eyes.\n</p><p>The representational scalar vocabularies of narrative storytelling are no longer good enough to describe the complex temporality and spatiality of the world. One that appears to be a composite matter of deep time water undersea, rocks, stones, forests, the body feminine, the marginalized, the repressed, the unconscious, and the algorithms. Global infrastructures, computer generated images, data behaviorism, all of the aspects of the new geo-political and economic interdependencies that make up our world. Simulation and tactical gameplay have come to replace historical folktales. History as a fictional linear progression that continuously follows on from event to event, that has a form of unity, western rootedness and continuity, is no longer perceived as sufficient enough to describe the diverse multitude of our current reality. History is the discourse of the powerful; it\u2019s the discourse of totalitarianism, of hegemony, which must be critiqued and questioned. Unfortunately these critical methods forever remain buried behind the thrust and efficacy of modeling volumetric unknowns.\n</p><p>Simulation is the new method of certainty, which borrows its art from cybernetics, particle physics and statistical mechanics. It has come to replace history, to break up its hold on reality, by presenting the past through multiplying perspectives. However, simulation comes in two flavors, that of <i>rehearsal</i> and of <i>training</i>. The latter is always seemingly co-opted and incorporated into volumetric regimes of the probable closing in on all the possibilities that could open up when history dissolves. The chaotic weather systems of social, political, animate and post-colonial perspectives, under the current regimes of volumetric terror, or simulation as training are tamed, suffocated in predictive echo chambers, from contingency and accident to calculated probabilities.\n</p><p>However, not all tactical gameplay is designed the same, simulations can appear as rehearsal on the one hand and training on the other. An example of simulation-as-training as opposed to rehearsal is the way that crewless vessels or autonomous cargo ships are trained through various volumetric exercises and modeling. To understand the possibilities of traversing the sea in the shortest amount of time, with the least amount of trouble. The experiments of the sea of past and beyond are no longer there. An autonomous ship does not sail for exploration, however problematic that term is, when considering colonial encounters. Even the colonial ships that wanted to discover and conquer, left a little bit of space for contingency, for the accident. The cargo autonomous ships, however, leave no room or margin for error. They must train for all scenarios regardless of their position. And if these ships encounter a scenario that is not part of the training package, then they no longer know what to do. A failure in this sense is not an opportunity for discovery, a failure is complete deadlock. The training of volumetric regimes is a future speculative exercise for closing up the future for minimizing error and risk. Furthermore, the difference between the rehearsal of the first-person taking command of the simulation engine on the one hand and the rehearsal of the autonomous machine learning system that is acting as an opponent on the other, is that simulators mould, through training, the corpus of living beings to the machine, while the autonomous system extracts the bodily presence from the rehearsal process. It\u2019s not training the body anymore it\u2019s training of data archived, extracted.\n</p><p>With the number of simulations trialed at the moment, it\u2019s almost as if we\u2019ve entered some form of \u201cTraining Paradigm\u201d, that is if we could ever again believe in the phenomena of paradigms or epochs. From marketing campaigns to political campaigns training on consumer or voter temperament, to competing models simulating virus paths, vaccine efficacy and the rate at which black and ethnics minorities are likely to get infected due to frontline jobs they are forced into by structural racism. Train the timeline, train for the unlikely scenario, learn the drill and prepare for the victor. Prepare the seven speeches only to read out the one that seems most fitting when you know the results. To train, a preparation for pointless anticipated activities. \n</p><p>The term \u201cre-hearse\u201d combines the Latin (re) with the old French <i>herse</i>, meaning harrow or a large rake used to turn the earth or ground, as in to reground or to take the ground again, to rake it again until all possible grounds have been considered.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn2_162-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn2-162\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> A distinction, however, should be made between rehearsal and training. If rehearsal is the repetition that maintains the openness of the rehearsed piece, a repetition that produces difference each time the piece is rehearsed, then training is the moment of closure in the process of rehearsal, when contingency is purposefully erased. What training does as every performer knows is that it destroys the spontaneity of the moment, \u201cThe performer, therefore, could not rehearse such music but rather \u201ctrained\u201d for it like a martial art, developing ways of acting upon contingency.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn3_163-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn3-163\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Training is in this sense different from the practice of rehearsal, which is a gesture of putting something into action, from the theory into practice. To train for something is to consider and attempt to foreclose all possible futures by unearthing various possible grounds for any future. When one trains they repeat an action in an attempt to erase the possibility for the accident, or erase the possibility of any kind of error. Training for a sport, for example, tends to optimize all the muscles towards a very specific and closed, aim that leaves no room for the accident. The accident in sport is always an injury.\n</p>\n<div class=\"quote\">\n GAME RULES PAGE 1: On June 13th, 1982, paratroopers and armour of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) rolled to the edge of Beirut, joining forces with their Phalange Christian allies. They never got much farther. The Palestine Liberation Organisation\u2019s attempt to organises a regular army had failed, but so had Israel\u2019s drive to exterminate it. This was a classic confrontation of modern diplomacy, where political pressure allowed a tiny force to fend off a giant. Beirut \u201982: Arab Stalingrad simulates the siege of Beirut, and its victory conditions recreate the diplomatic hindrances of that struggle.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn4_164-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn4-164\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></div>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Beirut_82.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Beirut 82.jpg\" src=\"/images/thumb/c/c1/Beirut_82.jpg/300px-Beirut_82.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/c/c1/Beirut_82.jpg/450px-Beirut_82.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/c/c1/Beirut_82.jpg/600px-Beirut_82.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Beirut_82.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>The above excerpt is taken from the 1989 edition of <i>Strategy and Tactics</i> magazine which was founded in 1966 by a US Air Force Staff Sergeant named Chris Wagner. The point of the magazine, or \u201cwar fanzine\u201d, was to produce more complex and therefore more realistic tactics in wargaming. The magazine had elements of a recreational wargaming magazine but as it was written by military political analysts and defense consultants who were keen to create something close enough to military wargaming. In 1969 James F. Dunnigan, a political analyst, formed Simulations Publications, Inc., a publishing house created specifically to publish the magazine.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn5_165-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn5-165\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The excerpt is the first paragraph of the game rule page that explains the rules of <i>Beirut \u201982: Arab Stalingrad</i>, a game based on <i>The Siege of Beirut</i>, one of the most defining events of the Lebanese Civil War. The siege took place in the summer of 1982 when the United Nation ceasefire between the Palestinian Liberation Army (PLO), who in the early 1970s made Lebanon its base of operations, and the Israeli army. After the siege the PLO were forced out of Beirut and the rest of Lebanon. <i>Strategy and Tactics</i> was one of the first wargaming magazines to include a wargame within its pages.\n</p><p>The main difference between so-called recreational wargames such as <i>Beirut \u201982: Arab Stalingrad</i>, however realistic and complex they intend to be, and military wargames, is that the former is usually regarded as a historical depiction of war. The training on tactics and strategies is replaying the events of a distant past. Wargaming has long performed World Wars I and II and the Napoleonic Wars as an act of remembrance and an interest of historians. Recreational games generally take creative liberties, by adding fictional elements, to make the game more enjoyable, more playable. For instance, scenarios would often be differently simplified in order to prioritize gameplay over event accuracy. However, <i>Strategy and Tactics</i> as a magazine that sits between tactical history and military strategy prides itself on being more realistic than other wargaming magazines.\n</p>\n<div class=\"quote\">\n<pre>GAME RULES PAGE 5, 6.0 CIVILIAN CASUALITIES: The CRT (rule 4.22) shows if an attack might cause Civilian Casualties, and what to multiply the result by.

When playing a game such as <i>Beirut \u201982: Arab Stalingrad</i> on the map insert placed in the centerfold of the publication, the gamer moves the Phalange army troops, as cardboard cut-outs of a right-wing Maronite party in Lebanon founded in 1936 by Pierre Gemayel, across the map. Such a move is a re-enactment of a particular procedure that relates to a complex system which reproduces what to some are painful historical events in relation to other possible futures, possible or probable futures that will never be. The combat is replaced with abstraction, supply and demand dynamics and other military considerations of algorithmic and numerically founded sets of possible outcomes all made random, a flipping of events at the throw of a die. <i>Beirut \u201982: Arab Stalingrad</i> is interesting not for its own sake but for in the manner in which it represents knowledge or history as a combination of both rehearsal and training, as simulation, or as Haron Farocki describes, \u201clife trained as a sport\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn7_167-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn7-167\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> <i>Beirut \u201982: Arab Stalingrad</i> is not only a simulation: it is one of the most nuanced and complex examples found in any medium. As a game it has eight pages of rules which explain actions, moves and procedures for circa one hundred game pieces and tokens around a 50cm by 40cm battle ground map of Beirut. It allows for a physically as well as conceptually extreme level of gameplay.\n</p><p>More than this, software gaming, from its inception, was quick to take interest in wargaming, which is different from games with military themes. Wargames were quick to translate to the screen and themes of Beirut 82 were no exception. The difference being that simulation now attempts to model all of the weapons, vehicles and aircrafts that were involved in the siege for show. Digital Combat Simulator\u2019s UH-1H Huey mission entitled Beirut 82 is an exemplar of the wargaming simulation offering a first-person experience of what it\u2019s like to be an American built Israeli helicopter flying over Beirut in 1982. The DCS website describes it as:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Digital Combat Simulator World (DCS World) 2.5 is a free-to-play digital battlefield game. Our dream is to offer the most authentic and realistic simulation of military aircraft, tanks, ground vehicles and ships possible\u2026 DCS: UH-1H Huey features an incredible level of modelling depth that reproducers the look, feel, and sound of this legendary helicopter with exquisite detail and accuracy. Developed in close partnership with actual UH-1H operators and experts, the DCS Huey provides the most dynamic and true to life conventional helicopter experience available on the PC. The UH-1 Huey is one of the most iconic and recognisable helicopters in the world. Having served extensively as a transport and armed combat support helicopter in the Vietnam War, the Huey continues to perform a wide variety of military and civilian missions around the world today.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn8_168-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn8-168\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Here the simulation is less interested in the historical strategies that play out a future otherwise. The volumetrics of the UH-1H Huey are there to both produce a so-called \u201cmodeling depth\u201d in order to train the gamer to fly the helicopter over the terrain Beirut. The \u201cmodeling depth\u201d of the Huey relates to a calculated time of the clock, not a temporality of sorts, but rather a time in the milliseconds, for instance, that it takes to fly the aircraft for calculations sake: calculation for calculations sake.\n</p><p>\u201cModeling depth\u201d also relates to the attention to visual and volumetric detail in the construction of the aircraft itself, to resolution. Depth here considers only pixel resolution of the type of visual dimension that captures the aircraft in a hyper computational state. It means very little to the people on the ground, viewing it as it shells its missiles, or captures prisoners who are their family members on the ground. In effect none of the events of Beirut 82 are captured in this simulation, not even the tactics and facts of history.\n</p><p>So, while in <i>Strategy and Tactics</i>, and the Beirut 82 replaying there is the probable and possible future that can be played and played again, even if it will never be realized. There is an opening for discussion of the past. In that sense, the past is being rehearsed as if it could have been otherwise. The tactical re-playing of past in that sense becomes a mode of open discussion within the game. Historical recollection can no longer be a simple story, narrative or folklore. Historical recollection has to include tactical exercises, a replaying, a repetition, a habit, a form of inhabiting the past which keeps its own tactical memories; the memory or schema of a victory that\u2019s played as tactical exercise. With the DCS: UH-1H Huey, however, the body of the gamer trains to fly the helicopter where the training is performed at the individual level siloed in the aircraft shooting down at the landscape, practicing nothing but flight skills and good aim.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Troops.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Troops.jpg\" src=\"/images/thumb/1/19/Troops.jpg/300px-Troops.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/1/19/Troops.jpg/450px-Troops.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/1/19/Troops.jpg/600px-Troops.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Troops.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Only in the openings between the tactical gameplay can there be remnants or conversations about an \u201cOther\u201d to hypercomputation. The slight opening in <i>Beirut \u201982: Arab Stalingrad</i>, within the gameplay allows for a possible outside of the probable. However, it does so in a manner that never gets cemented into writing, into a root that can be acted against, in a manner that aligns with what Glissant defined as \u201cerrantry\u201d. We do not yet know the general movement of errantry, \u201cthe desire to go against the root\u201d, the indigenous being of the colonized in relation to simulation, whether training or rehearsal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn9_169-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn9-169\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Even if <i>Beirut \u201982: Arab Stalingrad</i> permits a type of gameplay it remains a pointlessly ephemeral, fleeting moment that passes away as the game ends but leaves behind nothing but loss. It leaves the question open; How can the \u201ctraining\u201d convert into \u201crehearsal\u201d?\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_8\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Rehearsal_as_the_%E2%80%98Other%E2%80%99_to_Hypercomputation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn1-161\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn1_161-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\u00c9douard Glissant. <i>Poetics of Relation</i> (University of Michigan Press, 1997).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn2-162\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn2_162-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">* Rehearse.

We all have similar skills and are from a narrow selection of academic institutions. It is a very small ecosystem.\n</p><p>I followed a course around 2007 that is similar to what people do now. There\u2019s some of the technology that moves on for sure, but you\u2019re still learning the same kind of algorithms that were there in the 1950s or sixties or seventies. They were already old when I was doing them. You\u2019re still learning some parametrics, some generative design, generative algorithms, genetic algorithms, neural networks and cellular automatisms, it is absolutely a classic curriculum. Same texts, same books, same references. A real echo chamber.\n</p><p>One of the things I hated when I studied was the lack of diversity of thoughts, of criticality around these topics. And also the fact that there\u2019s only a very narrow cross-section of society involved in creating these kinds of techniques. If you ever mentioned the fact that some of these algorithmic approaches came from military research, the response was: \u201cSo what?\u201d. It wasn\u2019t even that they said that they already knew that. They were just like \u201cNothing to say about that, how can that possibly be relevant?\u201d\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_can_you_say_it_actually_works?\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_can_you_say_it_actually_works.3F\">How can you say it actually works?</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_hardly_encounter_anything_that_didn%E2%80%99t_really_matter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>PL</b>: When building the team, I was very conscious about not stepping straight into the use of generative design technologies, because we certainly haven\u2019t matured enough to start the conversation about how careful you have to be when using those techniques. We are working with quite complex situations and so we can\u2019t have a complex algorithm yet because we have too much to understand about the problem itself.\n</p><p>We started with a much more parametric and procedural design approach, that was much more... I wouldn\u2019t say basic... but lots of people in the team got quite frustrated at the beginning because they said, we <i>can</i> use this technique, why don\u2019t we just use this? It\u2019s only this year that we started using any kind of generative design algorithms at all. It was forced on us actually, by some external pressures. Some clients demanded it because it becomes very fashionable and they insisted that we did it. The challenges or the problems or the kind of slippage is how to try and build something that uses those techniques, but to do it consciously. And we are not always successful achieving that, by the way.\n</p><p>The biggest thing we were able to achieve is the transparency of the process because normally everything that you pile up to build one of those systems, gets lost. Because it is always about the performance of it, that is what everybody wants to show. They don\u2019t want to tell you how they built it up bit by bit. People just want to show a neural network doing something really cool, and they don\u2019t really want to tell you how they encoded all of the logic and how they selected the data. There are just thousands of decisions to make all the way through about what you include, what you don\u2019t include, how you privilege things and not privilege other things.\n</p><p>At some point, you carefully smooth all of the elements or you de-noise that process so much\u2026 You simplify the rules and you simplify the input context, you simplify everything to make it work, and then how can you say that it actually works? Just because it executes and doesn\u2019t crash, is that really the definition of functionality, what sort of truth does it tell you? What answers does it give you?\n</p><p>You make people try to understand what it does and you make people talk about it, to be explicit about each of those choices they make, all those rules, inputs, logics, geometry or data, what they do to turn that into a system. Every one of those decisions you make defines the n-dimensional space of possibilities. And if you take some very complicated input and you can\u2019t handle it in your process and you simplify so much, you\u2019ve already given a shape to what it could possibly emerge as. So one of the things we ended up doing is spending a lot of time on that and we discuss each micro step. Why are we doing it like this? It wasn\u2019t always easy for everyone because they didn\u2019t want to think about documenting all the steps.\n</p><p>Yesterday we had a two hour conversation about mesh interpolation and the start of the conversation was a data flow diagram, and one of the boxes just said something like: \u201cWe\u2019re just going to press this button and then it turns into a mesh\u201d. And I said: \u201cWoah, wait a minute!\u201d some people thought \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s just a feature, it\u2019s just an algorithm. It\u2019s just in the software, we can just do it.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo way.\u201d That\u2019s even before you get towards building something that acts on that model. I think that\u2019s what we got out of it actually, by not starting with the most let\u2019s say sophisticated approach, it has allowed us to have more time to reflect on what fueled the process.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Decisions_have_to_be_made\">Decisions have to be made</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_hardly_encounter_anything_that_didn%E2%80%99t_really_matter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Possible Bodies</b>: Do you think that transparency can produce a kind of control?

If it wasn\u2019t really affecting the system, it\u2019s probably because it was a bug in the process rather than anything else.\n</p><p>I think that transparency is not about gaining control of a process in itself, it\u2019s about being honest with the fact that you\u2019re creating something with a generative adversarial network (GAN) or a neural network, whatever it is.

We are developing an automated process for cable rooting for signaling systems in tunnels. We basically take a point cloud survey of a tunnel and we\u2019re trying to route this cable between obstacles. The tunnel is very small, there is no space, and obviously there\u2019s already a signaling system there. So there are cables everywhere and you can\u2019t take them out while you install the new ones, you have to find a pathway. Normally this would be done manually. Overnight people would go down in the tunnel and spray paint the wall and then photograph it and then come back to the office and try and draw it. So we\u2019re trying do this digitally and automate it in some way. There\u2019s some engineering rules of the cables, that have to be a certain diameter. You can\u2019t just bend them in any direction... it was a really nice geometric problem. The tunnel is a double curvature, and you have these point-clouds ... there were loads of quite nice little problems and you can get lost in it.\n</p><p><b>PB</b>: It doesn\u2019t sound like a boring project?\n</p><p><b>PL</b>: No it\u2019s absolutely not boring, it\u2019s just funny. None of us have worked in rail before. No one has ever worked in these contexts. We just turned up and went: \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it like that?\u201d\n</p><p>Once you finally get your mesh of the tunnel, what you\u2019re trying to do is subdivide that mesh into geometry again, another nice problem. A grid subdivision or triangles or hexagons, my personal favorite. And then you\u2019re trying to work out, which one of these grid subdivisions contains already a signal box, a cable or another obstruction basically? What sort of degree of freedom do I have to navigate through this? Taking a very detailed sub-millimeter accuracy point-cloud, that you\u2019re reducing into a subdivision of squares, simplifying it right down. And then you turn it into an evaluation. And then you have a path-finding algorithm that tries to join all the bits together within the engineering rules, within how you bend the cable. And you can imagine that by the time you get to start mesh subdivision, if you process that input to death, it\u2019s going to be absolutely meaningless. It will work in the sense that it will run and it will look quite cool, but what do I do with it?\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"I_try_to_talk_about_language_with_everybody\">I try to talk about language with everybody</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_hardly_encounter_anything_that_didn%E2%80%99t_really_matter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-6\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>PL</b>: I try to talk a little bit about language with everybody. I\u2019m trying not to overburden everybody with all of my predilections. I can\u2019t really impose anything on them. Language is a big thing, like explaining Genetic Algorithms with phrases like , \u201cSo this is the population that would kill everybody, that\u2019s like unsuitable or invalid.\u201d For example if you use a multi objective Genetic Algorithm, you might try to keep an entire set of all solutions or <i>configurations</i>, as we would call them, that you create through all of the generations of the process. The scientific language for this is \u201cpopulation\u201d. That\u2019s how you have to talk. You might say, \u201cI have a population of fifty generations of the algorithm. Five thousand individuals would be created throughout the whole process. And in each generation you\u2019re only \u201cbreeding\u201d or combining a certain set and you discard the others.\u201d You leave them behind, that\u2019s quite common. And we had a long talk about whether or not we should keep all of the things that were created and the discussion was going on like, \u201cBut some of them were just like rubbish. They\u2019re just stupid. We should just kill them, no one needs to see them again.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cwell I don\u2019t know, I quite like to keep everybody!\u201d\n</p><p>Of course all you\u2019re really doing is optimizing, tending towards something that\u2019s better and you lose the possibility of chance and miss something. There\u2019s a massive bit of randomness in it and you have a whole set of controls about how much randomness you allow through the generational processes and so I have this massive metaphor and it comes with huge, problematic language around genetics and all that kind of stuff that is encoded with even more problematic language, without any criticality, into the algorithmic process. And then someone is telling me \u201cI\u2019ve got a slider that says increase the randomness on that\u201d. So it\u2019s full of all those things, which I find very challenging.\n</p><p>But if you ever could strip away from the language and all of the kinds of problems, you look at it in purely just what it does, it\u2019s still interesting as a process and it can be useful, but the problem is not what the algorithm does. It\u2019s what culturally those algorithms have come to represent in people\u2019s imagination.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Hairy_Hominid_effect\">The Hairy Hominid effect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_hardly_encounter_anything_that_didn%E2%80%99t_really_matter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-7\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>PB</b>: We would like to bring up the Truthful Hairy Hominid here.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn165_173-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn165-173\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The figure emerged when looking over the shoulder of a designer using a combination of modeling softwares to update the representation of human species for the \u201cGallery of Humankind\u201d. They were working on one concrete specimen and the designer was modeling their hair, that was then going to be placed on the skin. And someone in our group asked the designer, \u201cHow do you know when to stop? How many hairs do you put on that face, on that body?\u201d And then the designer explained that there\u2019s a scientific committee of the museum that handed him some books, that had some information that was scientifically verified, but that all the rest was basically an invention. So he said that it\u2019s more or less this amount of hair or this color, this density of hair. And this is what we kept with us: When this representation is finished, when the model is done and brought from the basement to the gallery of the museum, that representation becomes the evidence of truth, of scientific truth.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn166_174-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn166-174\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><b>PL</b>: It acts like as a stabilization of all of those thoughts, scientific or not, and by making it in that way, it formalizes them and becomes unchallengeable.\n</p><p><b>PB</b>: The sudden arrival of an invented representation of hominids on the floor of a natural science museum, this functional invention, this efficacy, is turned into scientific truth. This is what we call \u201cThe Hairy Hominid effect\u201d. Maybe you have some stories related to this effect, on the intervention of what counts or what is accountable, what counts? Or is the tunnel already one?\n</p><p><b>PL</b>: Well, the technology of the tunnel project maybe is, and how we\u2019re using this stuff.\n</p><p>A point-cloud contains millions and millions of data-points from surveys, like in LiDAR scanning, it\u2019s still really novel to use them in our industry, even though the technology has been around for years.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn167_175-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn167-175\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> I would say the reason it still gets pushed as a thing is because it has become a massive market for proprietary software companies who say: \u201cHey, look, you have this really cool map, this really cool point cloud, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if you could actually use it in a meaningful way?\u201d And everybody goes, \u201cyes!\u201d, because these files are each four and a half gigabytes, you need a three thousand pound laptop to open it and it\u2019s not even a mesh, you can\u2019t really do anything with it, it just looks kind of cool. So the software companies go: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ll sell you thousands of pounds worth of software, which will process this for you into a mesh\u201d. But no one really is thinking about, well\u2026 how do you really process that?\n</p><p>A point-cloud is just as a collection of random points. You can understand that it is a tunnel or a school or a church by looking at it, but when you try and get in there and measure, if you\u2019re really trying to measure a point cloud ... what point do you choose to measure? And whilst they say the precision is like plus or minus zero point five millimeters... well, if that was true, why have we got so much noise?\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_only_thing_that\u2019s_real_are_the_data_points\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_only_thing_that.E2.80.99s_real_are_the_data_points\">The only thing that\u2019s real are the data points</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_hardly_encounter_anything_that_didn%E2%80%99t_really_matter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-8\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>PL</b>: One of the things that everybody that everybody thinks is useful, is to do object classification on a point-cloud, to find out what\u2019s a pipe, what\u2019s a light, what\u2019s a desk, what\u2019s a chair. To isolate only those points that you see and then put them on a separate layer in the model and isolate all those things by category. The way that that\u2019s mostly done right now, even in expensive proprietary software, is manually. So somebody sits there and puts a digital lasso around a bunch of points. But then how many of the points, when did you stop, how did you choose how to stop? Imagine, processing ten kilometer of tunnel manually...\n</p><p><b>PB</b>: It\u2019s nicer to go around with spray paint then.\n</p><p><b>PL</b>: Definitely. \n</p><p>The most extensive object classification techniques come from autonomous vehicles now, that\u2019s the biggest thing.

Just because a computer can just about recognize some things, it is not vision. I always think that computer vision is the wrong term. They should have called it computer perception.\n</p><p>There is a conflation between the uses of computer perception for object classification, around what even<i> is</i> an object and anyway, who really cares whether it\u2019s this type or this, what\u2019s it all for? Conflating object classification with point-cloud technology as a supposedly perfect representation, is actually useless because you can\u2019t identify the objects that you need and anyway, it has all these gaps, because it can\u2019t see through things and then there is a series of methods, to turn that into truth, you de-noise by only sampling one in every three points\u2026 You do all of these things to turn it into something that is \u2018true\u2019. That\u2019s really what it is like.

Did something change in your relation to the generative and it\u2019s potentially transformative potential?\n</p><p><b>PL</b>: I think it became more complex for me, when you actually have to do it in real life. I still think that there\u2019s huge risks in both approaches and at the time I probably thought that the reward is not worth the risk in parametric approaches. If you can be good at the generative thing, that\u2019s riskier, it\u2019s much easier to be bad at it, but the potential for possibilities is much higher.\n</p><p>What is more clear now is that these are general processes that you have to encounter, because everybody else is doing it, the bad ones are doing it. And I think it\u2019s a territory that I\u2019m not prepared to give up, that I don\u2019t want to encounter these topics on their terms. I don\u2019t consider the manifestations, those that we don\u2019t like in lots of different ways, to be the only way to use this technology. I don\u2019t consider them to be the intellectual owners of it either. I am not prepared to walk away from these techniques. I want to challenge what they are in some way.\n</p><p>Over the last few years of building things for people, and working with clients, and having to build while we were also trying to build a group of people to work together, you realize that the parametric or procedural approaches give you an opportunity to focus on what is necessary, to clarify the decision-making in all these choices you make. It is more useful in that sense. I was probably quite surprised how little people really wanted to think about those things in generative processes. So we had to start a little bit more simple.\n</p><p>You have to really think first of all, what is it you\u2019re going to make? Is it okay to make it? There\u2019s a lower limit almost of what\u2019s okay to make in a parametric tool because changes are really hard, because you lock in so many rules and relationships. The model can be just as complicated in a generative process, but you need to have a kind of fixed idea of what the relationships represent within your model, within your process. Whereas in generative processes, because of the very nature of the levels of abstraction, which cause problems, there are also opportunities. So without changing the code, you can just say, well, this thing actually is talking about something completely different. If you understand the math of it, you can assign a different name to that variable in your own mind, right? You don\u2019t even need to change the code.\n</p><p>With a parametric approach you\u2019re never going to get out of the fact that it is about a building of a certain type, you can never escape that. And we built parametric tools to design housing schemes or schools as well as some other infrastructure things, data centers even, and that is kind of okay, because the rules are not controversial when you think about schools for example. And you\u2019re probably thinking, hang on a minute, Phil, these can be controversial, but in the context of our problem definition, they were unchallengeable by anybody, they came from the government.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Showing_the_real_consequences\">Showing the real consequences</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_hardly_encounter_anything_that_didn%E2%80%99t_really_matter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-10\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>PL</b>: Parametric approaches make problems in the rules and processes visible.

Of course the algorithm cannot represent population or desire.\u201d But then when the system needs to work, it is apparently easy to let go of what that means. The need to make it work, erases the possibility for critique.\n</p><p><b>PL</b>: One of the common responses I see is something like, \u201cYeah, but it is better than nothing.\u201d Or that is at least part of the story. They have a very Modernist idea that you run this linear trajectory towards complete know-how or knowledge or whatever and that these systems are incomplete rather than imperfect and that if you have a bit more time, you\u2019ll get there.

Just do it with an algorithm!\u201d They\u2019ve fallen for that capitalist idea that technology will always work in the end. It <i>must</i> work. And whenever I present my work in conferences, I always talk about my team, what people are in the team, how we built it in some way. To the point that actually lot\u2019s of people get bored of it. Other people when they talk about these kinds of techniques will say \u201cWe\u2019ve got this bright kid he\u2019s got a PhD from wherever. He\u2019s brilliant. He just sits in the corner. He\u2019s just brilliant.\u201d And of course, it\u2019s always a guy as well. They instrumentalize these people, as the device to execute their dream, which is that the computer will do everything. There\u2019s still this kind of a massively Modernist idea that it\u2019s just a matter of time until we get to that.\n</p><p>Sometimes a point-cloud is <i>not</i> better than nothing because it gives you a whole other problem to deal with, another idea of reality to process.

You\u2019re wrestling with very complicated processes and by the time you think that you kind of control it, it just controlled you, it made you change your idea of the problem. You simplify your own problem in order that you can have a process act on it.

At most they would talk about the moment of constraint being beyond the horizon of usefulness. At some point, it doesn\u2019t create every possible combination. Lots of people think that it can create every option that you could ever think of. Other people would say that it is not infinite, but it goes beyond the boundary of what you would call, \u2018the useful extent of your solution space\u2019, which is the kind of terminology they use. I think that there\u2019s a myth that exists, that through a generative process, you can have whatever you want. And I have been in meetings where we showed clients something that we\u2019ve done and they say, \u201cOh, so you just generated all possible options.\u201d But that\u2019s not quite what we did last week!\n</p><p>There\u2019s still that sort of myth-making around genetic algorithms, there\u2019s an illusion there. And I think there\u2019s a refusal to acknowledge that the boundary of that solution space is set not really by the process of generation. It\u2019s set at the beginning, by the way in which you define the stuff that you act on, through your algorithmic process. I think that\u2019s true of parametrics as well, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s more obviously to improve metrics. Like, here\u2019s a thing that affects this thing. And whether you complexify the relationships between those parameters, it doesn\u2019t really matter, it\u2019s still kind of conceptually very easy to understand. No matter how complex you make the relations between those parameters, you can still get your head around it. Whereas the generative process is a black box to a certain extent, no one really knows, and the constraint is always going to be on the horizon of useful possibilities.

It feels like we\u2019re back in the early nineties actually. When computational technology emerged into everyday life, it was largely unknown or was unknowable at the time to the receiving audience, to the consumers. There was a separation, an us and them, and even talking about a terrible version of Windows or Word or something, people were still understanding it as something that came from this place over there. Over the last two or three decades, those two things are brought together, and it feels much more horizontal; anybody can be a programmer. And now we\u2019re back at the place where we realize that not everybody can be part of creating these things at all.\n</p><p>Governments have this idea that we\u2019ll all be programmers at some point. But no, we won\u2019t, that\u2019s absolutely not true! Not everybody\u2019s going to learn. So one of the things I try to specifically hold on is that we need to bring computational technology to our industry, rather than have it created by somebody else and then imposed on us.\n</p><p>The goal is not to learn how to be all a software company or a tech company.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"If_something_will_work,_why_not_use_it?\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"If_something_will_work.2C_why_not_use_it.3F\">If something will work, why not use it?</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_hardly_encounter_anything_that_didn%E2%80%99t_really_matter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-17\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>PB</b>: We are troubled by the way 3D techniques and technologies travel from one discipline to another.

We have quite a few arguments about the use of image recognition or facial recognition technologies for example.\n</p><p>When technologies translate into another discipline, into another job almost, you don\u2019t just lose the ability to critique it, but it actually enhances its status by that move. When you reuse some existing technology, people think you must be so clever to re-apply it in a new context. In the UK there are tons of examples of R&amp;D government funding that would encourage you to use established existing techniques and technologies from other sectors and reapply them in design and construction. They don\u2019t want you to reinvent something and they certainly don\u2019t want you to challenge anything. You\u2019re part of the process of validating it and you\u2019re validated by it. And similarly, the people of the originating discipline get to say, \u201cLook how widely used the thing we created is\u201d, and then it becomes a reinforcement of those disciplines. I think that it\u2019s a huge problem for anyone\u2019s ability to build critical practices towards these technologies.\n</p><p>That moment of transition from one field to another creates the magic, right? A technology apparently appears out of nowhere, lands fully formed almost without friction and without history. It lacks history in the academic sense, the scientific process and indeed, also lacks the labor of all of the bodies, the people that it took to make it, no one cares anymore at that point.\n</p><p>What I\u2019ve seen in the last five years is that proprietary software companies are pushing things like face recognition and object classification into Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), into desktop software. Something like a GAN or whatever is not a button and not a product; it is a TensorFlow routine or a bunch of Python scripts that you get off GitHub.\n</p><p>There\u2019s a myth-making around this, that makes you feel like you\u2019re still engaged in the kind of practice of creating the technique. But you\u2019re not, you\u2019re just consuming it. It\u2019s ready-made there for you. Because it sits on GitHub, you feel like a real coder, right? I think the recipient context becomes infantilized because you\u2019re not encouraged to actually create it yourself.\n</p><p>You\u2019re presented with something that will work, so why not use it? But this means you also consume all of their thinking all of their ways of looking at the world.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_9\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_hardly_encounter_anything_that_didn%E2%80%99t_really_matter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-18\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn162-170\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn162_170-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">See: Possible Bodies, \u201cMakeHuman,\u201d in this book.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn163-171\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn163_171-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">See: \u201cPhil Langly in conversation with Possible Bodies, Comprehensive Features,\u201d <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://volumetricregimes.xyz/index.php?title=Comprehensive_Features\">https://volumetricregimes.xyz/index.php?title=Comprehensive_Features</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn164-172\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn164_172-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">TensorFlow is \u201cAn end-to-end open source machine learning platform\u201d used for both research and production at Google. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\">https://www.tensorflow.org/</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn165-173\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn165_173-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\u201cItem 086: The Truthful Hairy Hominid,\u201d <i>The Possible Bodies Inventory,</i> 2014.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn166-174\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn166_174-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Another aspect of the <i>Hairy Hominid effect</i> appears in our conversation with Simone C Niquille, \u201cThe Fragility of Life,\u201d in this chapter. </span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn167-175\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn167_175-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">LiDAR is an acronym of \u201clight detection and ranging\u201d or \u201claser imaging, detection, and ranging\u201d.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section somo\">\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Somatopologies:_On_the_ongoing_rendering_of_corpo-realities\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=Somatopologies:_On_the_ongoing_rendering_of_corpo-realities&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Somatopologies: On the ongoing rendering of corpo-realities (page does not exist)\">Somatopologies: On the ongoing rendering of corpo-realities</a></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Unfolded&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Somatopologies: On the ongoing rendering of corpo-realities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"running-header-section\">Somatopologies</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"contribution clumsy-volumetrics\">\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Clumsy_Volumetrics\">Clumsy Volumetrics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Clumsy_Volumetrics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Helen V. Pritchard</b>\n</p><p><br />\nOpening the on-line <i>Possible Bodies Inventory,</i> we encounter an abundance of items \u2014 shifting numbered entries of manuals, mathematical concepts, art-projects and micro-CT images of volumetric presences. So-called bodies in the context of hardware for scanning, tracking, capturing and of software tools for data processing and 3D-visualization. Working on-and-with the <i>Possible Bodies Inventory</i> is an inquiry on the materialization of bodies and spaces, in dizzying relation with volume practices. As discussed throughout this book, the volumetric regime directs what so-called bodies are \u2014 and how they are \u201cshaped by the lines they follow\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn168_176-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn168-176\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> As Sara Ahmed outlines in her queer phenomenology, orientations matter in \ufeffhow they shape what becomes socially as well as bodily given; that is how\ufeff bodies materialize and take shape.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn169_177-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn169-177\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Many items in the <i>Possible Bodies Inventory</i> evidence how the orientations of 3D practices matter significantly in materializing spaces for bodies that are inhabitable for some, and not others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn170_178-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn170-178\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Rocha and Snelting refer to this as the the \u201cvery probable colonial, capitalist, hetero-patriarchal, ableist and positivist topology of contemporary volumetrics.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn171_179-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn171-179\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Indeed the <i>Possible Bodies Inventory</i> demonstrates how the inherited histories of colonialism stretch into 3D practices to shape and direct bodies: \u201c\ufeffcolonialism makes the world \u2018white\u2019, which is of course a world \u2018ready\u2019 for certain kinds of bodies, as a world that puts certain objects within their reach\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn172_180-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn172-180\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> This orientation starts within the worldsetting of x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 and spreads out across 3D space; the mesh, the coordinate system, geometry and finally, the world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn173_181-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn173-181\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> However, what are the orientations that spread from this computational world-setting to shape spaces? How does it also reinforce what is already made reachable or not, livable or not, from what Louis Althusser calls the zero point of orientation, from which the world unfolds?<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn174_182-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn174-182\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> \ufeffAs Possible Bodies observe in <i>Item 007: Worldsettings for beginners</i>:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using software manuals as probes into computational realities, we traced the concept of \u201cworld\u201d in Blender, a powerful Free, Libre and Open Source 3D creation suite. We tried to experience its process of \u201cworlding\u201d by staying on the cusp of \u201centering\u201d into the software. Keeping a balance between comprehension and confusion, we used the sense of dis-orientation that shifting understandings of the word \u201cworld\u201d created, to gauge what happens when such a heady term is lifted from colloquial language to be re-normalized and re-naturalized. If the point of origin changes, the world moves but the body doesn\u2019t.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As Possible Bodies feel-out, in their software critique of 3D graphics software <i>Blender</i>, in volumetric regimes, when worlds are set, the possibilities for bodies are narrowly scripted \u2014 computationally pre-determining the objects that stay in reach. And like in the physical world these \u201corientations become socially given by being repeated over time\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn175_183-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn175-183\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Indeed, as <i>Item 007</i> shows, volumetric world-settings are an attempt to fix in place how the world unfolds from a zero-point orientation. An orientation which shapes and is shaped by a certain kind of body as a norm and what Ahmed calls less room to wiggle \u2014 \u201c[l]ess wiggle room: less freedom to be; less being to free\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn176_184-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn176-184\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> So, in volumetric regimes \u2014 when worlds are <i>world-set</i> in ways that computationally shape the body to the world, through directions between fixed points, what about the bodies that don\u2019t fit or don\u2019t follow the set directions?\n</p><p>Ahmed suggests that \u201cclumsiness\u201d might be the way to form a queer and crip ethics to generate new openings and possibilities. Clumsy referring to when we wiggle off the path, are out of time with each other and become in the way of ourselves:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Bodies that wriggle might be crip bodies, as well as a queer bodies; bodies that do not straighten themselves out. The elimination of wriggle might be one form of what Robert McRuer calls \u201ccompulsory able-bodied-ness,\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn177_185-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn177-185\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> which is tied to compulsory [cis-gendered] straightness, to being able to follow as closely as you can the line you are supposed to follow.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn178_186-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn178-186\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Making the affinity present between queer and crip, Ahmed notes, clumsiness is not always a process which brings us together or attunes us, it can also be the moments \u2013 the desiring moments \u2013 when we bump into the world. Clumsiness is a powerful political orientation, one in which our ways of relating to, and depending on, each other are reconfigured, promising as McRuer notes, possibilities to \u201csomehow access other worlds and futures\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn179_187-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn179-187\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> By awkwardly reaching towards some of the items at the inventory, can we orient volumetric practices that make wiggle room, deviate from straightness and open up new liberatory paths? Informed by the difficulties of following the paths of queer life and world-declarations, might we form paths of queer desire for bodies? Such desire might pass through tentative processes to de-universalize, de-centralize, de-compose and re-visit tools and practices in order to better understand the conditions of their mutual constitution. Paths made through workarounds, interventions and hacks of volumetric hardwares and softwares that deviate from social-givens.\n</p><p>Queerness matters because it affects what we can do, where we can go, how we are perceived, and so on. Yet we also know about creative wiggles, wiggling off paths when our bodies don\u2019t fit and the queer wiggle of wiggling in cramped spaces.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn180_188-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn180-188\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Ahmed writes that for queers \u201c\ufeffit is hard to simply stay on course because love is also what gives us a certain direction\u201d creating orientations of desire that generate new shapes and new impressions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn181_189-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn181-189\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> However, although love might give us a certain direction, it can take a lot of work to switch orientations. Turning towards a queer ethics of clumsiness for volumetrics then might take some work to make room for non-attunement, not seeing this as a loss of possibility but as opening new paths; making accounts of the damages done to bodies who stray from the world-settings of volumetric regimes; and unfolding new ways which bodies shape and are shaped by calculations.\n</p><p>As the disobedient action research of <i>Item 007</i> demonstrates, in computer graphics and other geometry-related data processing, calculations are based on Cartesian coordinates, consisting of three different dimensional axis: x, y and z. In 3D-modelling, this is what is referred to as \u201cthe world\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn182_190-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn182-190\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> The point of origin literally figures as the beginning of the local or global computational context that a 3D object functions. But what is this world that is set and how does it shape or is shaped by so-called bodies? In a discussion of facial reconstruction by forensic science, Vicki Kirby, drawing on Bruno Latour\u2018s work on scientific reference, suggests we would be wrong to assume that the relationships conjured in 3D modelling are simply an illusion or mirror.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn183_191-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn183-191\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Instead, Kirby demonstrates that there is a relationship between 3D models and the physical world, what she calls communicative intimacies and peculiar correspondences, that are conjured between a 3D modelled face and the data gathered from a fragment of a skull.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn184_192-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn184-192\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> That is to say there is often some resonance between data collected in one site and modelled or visualized in another, which opens up the possibility for agency in 3D. Forensic science practices are based on techniques that pre-date computers, but that are refined by the use of ultrasound data from living people, computed tomography (CT scans), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) and Kirby shows how:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>data taken from one temporal and spatial location can contain information about another; a fragment of skull is also a sign of the whole, just as an individual skull seems to be a specific expression of a universal faciality. In other words, there is no simple presence versus absence in these examples.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn185_193-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn185-193\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kirby proposes (following Latour) that this is because the world, \ufeffas a more-than-human assembly, has the capacity to produce nodes of reference, or evidence, that effectively correspond.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn186_194-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn186-194\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> That is, <i>the world is present</i> in 3D scans and models. Kirby suggests this means we need then to consider the possibility of the peculiar correspondence between the physical world and 3D models not as loss, or reduction of nature/world but as its playful affirmation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn187_195-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn187-195\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> This recognition <i>does</i> open up the powerful possibility for a 3D practice which is understood as inhabited by the liveliness of the world. However what Kirby <i>does not</i> acknowledge is that because the world <i>is</i> present in 3D practices, they are also already materially oriented towards social givens of what faces (or forests) are. This is particularly poignant in the model of an \u201cevolutionary\u201d body type facial reconstruction documented in <i>Item 086: The Truthful Hairy Hominid.</i> The item shows us documentation from an excursion to the basement of the Natural Sciences Museum in Brussels, highlighting the dependence of 3D practices of facial reconstruction on scientific racism. This is also evidenced in the research of Abigail Nieves Delgado, who through a series of semi-structured interviews with experts in facial reconstruction, shows how \u201cwhen reconstructing a face, experts carry out a particular way of seeing [...] that interprets visible differences in bodies as racial differences\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn188_196-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn188-196\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> She suggests that this analysis highlights that facial reconstructions should be understood as objects that allow us to trace past and present pathways of racial thinking in science. Delgado shows how the scientists and modellers she interviewed see skull shapes as part of specific narratives about purity, mixture, nation and race, narratives that reiterate the violence of scientific racism. Delgado argues that \u201cby looking at facial reconstruction, we also learn that to stop reproducing race means to stop seeing [and modelling] in racial terms\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn189_197-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn189-197\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> \u2014 a way of seeing based on racialized categories that have become embedded within scientific practices as neutral. This normative seeing is held in place by 3D volumetrics and facial reconstruction practice. So, whilst we might recognize that the world is present in 3D models and this opens up possibilities for encountering the liveliness of the world, we also need to recognize these same models are informed by the inherited histories of the sciences in which they operate.\n</p><p>Alongside the violent directive softwares and hardwares of the industrial continuum of volumetric regimes, the <i>Possible Bodies Inventory</i> also holds and sorts propositions that hold the liveliness of the world, its shaping capacities and find ways to remake volumetrics, destabilizing the inherited histories of colonialism, ableism and racism within the sciences that inform 3D practices. The queer and crip volumes are full of the pleasure, tenderness and excitement of opening worlds. Hacked scanners, misused models, lumpy bodies all create glimmering deviations, which rotate as alternative volumetrics. These inventory items generate the proposal of working with other references within 3D modelling, held in tension with the technical aspects of 3D modelling. Or as Snelting discusses:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>we might use awkwardness to move beyond thinking about software in terms of control using awkwardness as a strategy to cause interference, to create pivotal moments between falling and moving, an awkward in-between that makes space for thinking without stopping us to act.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn190_198-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn190-198\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>This pleasurable, loving, reorientating between falling and moving in the <i>Possible Bodies Inventory</i> includes inventory items that make present volumes generated by human and more-than-human bodies such as scanner, flowers, plants, trees, human gestures, minerals and anatomy. Working on and with these inventory items is alike to what Jas Rault and T. L. Cowan describe as entering into a collective deep queer processing \u2014 \u201cthe possibilities for understanding process as a sexy, sometimes agonized but always committed, method, an orientation towards unruly information\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn191_199-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn191-199\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>One of these orientations towards unruly information is <i>Item 035: Difficult Forests</i> by Sina Seifee, <i>Difficult Forests</i> turns us to moving coordinates, colors and what Seifee describes as <i>Memoirs</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn192_200-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn192-200\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>&#160;In 2013 Seifee travelled to the Amazon region in Colombia with the Kinect as a recording device. The Kinect was hacked to work as a kind of LiDAR to create a series of digital memoirs spelled out as systematic screen glitches, technological relationships and life histories:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The representation of the journey \u2014 itself as complex problematic event \u2014 together with the horde of visual artifacts tell a set of interfacial stories with my co-travellers. This project addresses the splicing of direct and tactile human perception of reality with another reality, one that is mediated and technical. It is an aesthetic dream, dream of isomorphism between the discursive object and the visible object in the Amazonian forests.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn193_201-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn193-201\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p><i>Difficult Forests</i> generates queer traces of desire, the images and text creating different routes to get to this point or to that point. Here deviating in the forest resets stability and make new co-ordinates of points between so-called bodies \u2014 they wiggle from the 0,0,0 of worldsetting. Seifee discusses how sometimes the Kinect is held by him, sometimes by his companion or the 3 year old with them. Destabilizing the imaginary of the lone able-bodied cis male scientist who scans the forest under difficult conditions, the different paths become queer intergenerational \u201cmultiple world-declarations\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn194_202-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn194-202\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Using the hacked Kinect to generate measurements from a zero point that is never still, <i>Item 035</i>&#160;opens up the possibility for the movement between points to be queered, to be reinhabited and change course, whilst not letting go of the possibilities of volumetric knowledge&#160;production. The Kinect extends the reach of the body, whose bodies reach and the forest. Seifee documents this extension of reach in the images and text, recording how the body becomes-with the difficult forest as it takes in that which is \u201cnot\u201d it. What Ahmed describes as the \u201cthe acquisition of new capacities and directions \u2014 becoming, in other words, \u201cnot\u201d simply what I am \u201cnot\u201d but what I can \u201chave\u201d and \u201cdo\u201d. The \u201cnot me\u201d is incorporated into the body, extending its reach\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn195_203-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn195-203\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> These more-than-human capacities and directions shape forest, scanner and body. As Seifee notes, \u201cThe forest recorded and screen captured while walking in a \u201cdirectly lived\u201d space \u2014 in sweat, heat, fatigue and mosquito bite\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn196_204-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn196-204\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> The result is a corrupted Kinect scan of the forest, where the mapped surfaces of leaves float around a body without stable ground, as the forest unfolds. It asks us to consider the practice of 3D scanning as a practice of memoir in which the world is made present as a shaping that unfolds through surface encounters (rather than linear methods of collection).\n</p><p>In these memoirs <i>Difficult Forests</i> seems marked with details that are the \u201cindelible and complex entanglements of nature/culture\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn197_205-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn197-205\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> The memoirs of <i>Difficult Forests</i>, are more-than-human and dazzling with the reticulant agency of the forest. As Seifee notes, \u201cthe Amazon rainforest still resists to remain a radical nonhuman surrounding on the surface of the earth\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn198_206-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn198-206\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> The memoirs problematize the overlapping surface and jungle, yet the result is not a visual without reference \u2014 both scientific and affective. The images correspond to a set of measured points and the forest is still present in a felt shaping way. We witness the dense and lively agency of the forest and the human-machine scanners in this unstable scan. <i>Difficult Forests</i> reminds us that there is a possibility to conjure a looser translation between local and global coordinates one that stays with the openings 3D offers but also proposes new ways of seeing with 3D. It reorients the translation between the local and global&#160;(data) that emerges from 3D scanning in inventive ways \u2014 making room for deviations from set paths between points and bodies that emerge as different shapes.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:702px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Difficultforest.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/4/45/Difficultforest.jpg/700px-Difficultforest.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"495\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/4/45/Difficultforest.jpg/1050px-Difficultforest.jpg 1.5x, /images/4/45/Difficultforest.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Difficultforest.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Sina Seifee, <i>Difficult Forests</i>, 2013</div></div></div>\n<p>Scanning differently is also explored in <i>Item 33</i>, Pascale Barret\u2019s work <i>This obscure side of sweetness is waiting to blossom</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn199_207-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn199-207\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> <i>Item 33</i> is a flowering bush made present as a 3D printed object through unconventional uses of scanning devices, point clouds and surface meshes. If we tenderly hold <i>Item 33</i> in our hands, we can feel out the unfinished 3D printed edges and uncontainable volumes. The awkward lumpy mass of scanned leaves and 3D printing support structures enacts a clumsy wiggling from what has become an accepted path of 3D practices \u2014 in which objects are often presented as smoothed-off naturalized accounts or miniaturizations. Whilst still drawing lines between points, this inventory item proposes to us the possibilities for working with practices in ways that inhabit space-time of bodies-plants-scanners in a much different way. In contrast to the practice of 3D modelling which aims to capture data to recreate or reflect fixed bodies in fixed \u201cnature\u201d, such as the 1:1 copy of a flower or leaf, this work allows an orientation in a world that is in excess of the scanner and is not made of straight lines or entities with hard boundaries. Rather than using the scanner as apparatus of colonial capture <i>Item 33</i> advocates for what Jessica Lehman calls the need to recognize volume beyond volumetrics. As Lehman outlines, \u201c[v]olumes are irreducible to and in excess of the apparatuses of their capture, whether big science or state power\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn200_208-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn200-208\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> A materiality that is more-than just resistant to or compliant with volumetrics. Indeed, the amalgamated movements of scanner, bodies and the plants that are shown within the 3D print make explicit the more-than-human and reticulant materiality of volume, a volume which does make present the world but is also in excess of scientific reference. An orientation towards other ways of understanding the materialization of data, practice, movement, bodies, and scanning. A volumetric practice that might provide (situated, temporary) truths about lives.\n</p><p>Both the degenerate Kinect scans of <i>Difficult Forests</i> and the knobbly 3D print of Barret\u2019s encounter of the blossoming bush are \u201cvolumizations\u201d of how moving towards and getting close to objects with computation is difficult yet also shapes us \u2014 difficulty shapes us. The items makes-felt what Lauren Berlant describes as the unbearability of being oriented by objects:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The critical object is unbearable much like the object of love is: too present, distant, enigmatic, banal, sublime, alluring and aversive; too much and too little to take in, and yet, one discovers all this only after it\u2019s been taken in, however partially, always partially, and yet overwhelmingly even at the smallest points of genuine contact.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn201_209-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn201-209\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the directing capacities of many items within the inventory bring attention to the impossibility of resolving ambivalence in our knowledge practices.\n</p><p>The <i>Possible Bodies Inventory</i> is a proposal to consider computation as a shaping force on bodies as well as shaped by those bodies \u2014 but importantly as this tour has shown the room for bodies to shape volumetrics may be constrained by inherited histories and social givens. These inventory items open new paths by their wiggle work orientating away from the inherited constraints, rethinking what it means to compute volumes \u2014 generating queer and crip ethics to orient practices. As inventory items <i>Difficult Forests</i> and <i>This obscure side of sweetness is waiting to blossom</i> hint, 3D practices such as scanning might make possible smallest points of genuine contact with the materiality of the world, without demanding a stabilizing resolution or normative relations<i>.</i> These two items propose a type of pleasurable queer processing, a clumsy computing that works against the muscular straight lines and modes of reduction for efficiency within volumetric practices. Making-possible the presence of the world without overstabilizing paths or resolving the difficulty of contact. Generating volumes that work-with rather than against the body in motion \u2014 queer wiggles that move us towards other bodies, objects and political transformations even in tight, hard to reach spaces.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:702px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Blossom.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/6/69/Blossom.jpg/700px-Blossom.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"516\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/6/69/Blossom.jpg/1050px-Blossom.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/6/69/Blossom.jpg/1400px-Blossom.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Blossom.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Pascale Barret, <i>This obscure side of sweetness is waiting to blossom</i>, 2017</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"page-break\"></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_10\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Clumsy_Volumetrics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn168-176\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn168_176-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Sara Ahmed, <i>Queer Phenomenology: Orientations, Objects, Others</i> (Duke University Press, 2006), 133.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn169-177\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn169_177-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ahmed, <i>Queer Phenomenology</i></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn170-178\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn170_178-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">See also for example Romi Ron Morrison, \u201cEndured Instances of Relation, an exchange,\u201d Possible Bodies, \u201cSo-called Plants,\u201d and Jara Rocha, \u201cDepths and Densities: A bugged report,\u201d in this book.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn171-179\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn171_179-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Jara Rocha, and Femke Snelting, \u201cThe Industrial Continuum of 3D,\u201d in this book.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn172-180\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn172_180-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ahmed, <i>Queer Phenomenology</i>, 87.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn173-181\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn173_181-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Possible Bodies, \u201cDisorientation and its Aftermath,\u201d in this book.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn174-182\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn174_182-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Edmund Husserl, \u201cIdeas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy: Second Book Studies in the Phenomenology of Constitution,\u201d Vol. 3.

From software development to character animation, from scientific proof to surveillance, the practices crossing through MakeHuman produce images, imaginations and imaginaries that are part of a concrete and situated cultural assemblage of hetero-patriarchal positivism and humanism. Found in and fed by mainstream mediated representations, these imaginations generally align with the body stereotypes that belong to advanced capitalism and post-colonialist projections. Virtual bodies only look \u201cnormal\u201d because they appear to fit into that complex situation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Un-taming_the_whole\">Un-taming the whole</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=MakeHuman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The signature feature of the MakeHuman interface is a set of horizontal sliders. For a split second, the surprising proposal to list \u201cgender\u201d as a continuous parameter, promises wild combinations. Could it be that MakeHuman is a place for imagining humanoids as subjects in process, as open-ended virtual figures that have not yet materialized? But the uncomfortable and yet familiar presence of physical and cultural properties projected to the same horizontal scale soon shatters that promise. The interface suggests that the technique of simply interpolating parameters labeled \u201cGender\u201d, \u201cAge\u201d, \u201cMuscle\u201d, \u201cWeight\u201d, \u201cHeight\u201d, \u201cProportions\u201d, \u201cCaucasian\u201d, \u201cAfrican\u201d and \u201cAsian\u201d suffices to make any representation of the human body. The unmarked extremities of the parameters are merely a way to outsource normativity to the user, who can only blindly guess the outcomes of the algorithmic calculations launched by handling the sliders. The tool invites a comparison between \u201cGender\u201d to \u201cWeight\u201d for example, or to slide into racial classification and \u201cProportions\u201d through a similar gesture. Subtle and less subtle shifts in both textual and visual language hint at the trouble of maintaining the one-dimensionality of this 3D world-view: \u201cGender\u201d (not \u201cSex\u201d) and \u201cWeight\u201d are labeled as singular but \u201cProportions\u201d is plural; \u201cAge\u201d is not expressed as \u201cYoung\u201d nor \u201cOld\u201d, while the last slider proposes three racialized options for mixture. They appear as a matter of fact, right below other parameters, as if equal to the others, proposing racialization as a comparable and objective vector for body formation, represented as finite (and consequently factual) because they are named as a limited set.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn223_232-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn223-232\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> We want to signal two things: one, that the persistent technocultural production of race is evidenced by the discretization of design elements such as the proportion of concrete bodyparts, chromatic levels of so-called skin, and racializing labels; and two, that the modeling software itself actively contributes to the maintenance of racism by reproducing representational simplifications and by performing the exclusion of diversity by means of solutionist tool operations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn224_233-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn224-233\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Further inspection reveals that even the promise of continuity and separation is based on a trick. The actual math at work reveals an extremely limited topology based on a closed system of interconnected parameters, tightening the space of these bodies through assumptions of what they are supposed to be. This risky structuration is based on reduced humanist categories of \u201cproportionality\u201d and \u201cnormality\u201d. Parametric design promises infinite differentiations but renders them into a mere illusion: obviously, not all physical bodies resulting from that combination would look the same, but software can make it happen. The sliders provide a machinic imagination for utilitarianised (supposedly human) compositors, conveniently covering up how they function through a mix of technical and cultural normativities. Aligning what is to be desired with the possible, they evidently mirror the binary systems of the Modern proposal for the world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn225_234-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn225-234\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The point is not to \u201cfix\u201d these problems, quite the contrary. We experimented with replacing default values with random numbers, and other ways to intervene with the inner workings of the tool. But only when we started rewriting the interface, we could see it behave differently.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn226_235-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn226-235\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> By renaming labels, replacing them with questions and more playful descriptions, by adding and distracting sliders, the interface became a space for narrating through the generative process of making possible bodies.\n</p><p>A second technique of representation at work is that of geometric modeling or polygon meshes. A mesh consolidates an always-complete collection of vertices, edges, planes and faces in order to define the topology of an individualized shape. Each face of a virtual body is a convex polygon; this is common practice in 3D computer graphics and simplifies the complexity of the calculations needed for rendering. Polygon meshes are deeply indebted to the Cartesian perspective by their need for wholeness. It results in a firm separation of first inside from outside and secondly shape or topology from surface. The particular topology of MakeHuman is informed by a rather awkward sense of chastity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn227_236-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn227-236\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> With all it\u2019s pride in \u201canatomical correctness\u201d and high-resolution rendering, it has been decided to place genitals outside the base-body-mesh. The dis-membered body-parts are relegated to a secondary zone of the interface, together with other accessories such as hats and shoes. As a consequence, the additional set of skin-textures included in MakeHuman does not include the genital add-ons so that a change in material makes them stand out, both as a potentiality for otherwise embodied otherness and as evidence of the cultural limitations to represent physical embodiment.\n</p><p>In MakeHuman, two different technical paradigms (parametric design and mesh-based perspective) are allied together to grow representative bodies that are renormalized within a limited and restricted field of cultivated material conditions, taming the infinite with the tricks of the \u201cnatural\u201d and the \u201chorizontal\u201d. It is here that we see Modern algorithms at work: sustaining the virtual by providing certain projections of the world, scaled up to the size of a powerful presence in an untouchable present. But what if the problematic understanding of these bodies being somehow human, and at the same time being made by so-called humans, is only one specific actualization emerging from an infinite array of possibilities contained in the virtual? What if we could understand the virtual as a potential generator of differentiated and differentiating possibilities? This might lead us towards mediations for many other political imaginaries.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn228_237-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn228-237\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_potential_for_imaginations\">A potential for imaginations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=MakeHuman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>By staging MakeHuman through a performative spectrum, the software turned into a thinking machine, confirming the latent potential of working through software objects.

We are trying to think about separation and difference specifically in relation to volumetric computational processes that de-flatten or re-flatten, model, capture, track and so forth.</b>\n</p><p>I think entanglement is the word.\n</p><p>For me, your question seems to recursively return to this. Entanglement implies a relation. Perhaps one that evades or overdetermines what cannot presently be grasped but nonetheless, a relation. Entanglement is helpful for me to think through because it doesn\u2019t resolve into an easy self contained knowability, but it also doesn\u2019t mask itself within the complete opacity of being unknowable to the extent of any totality. Rather, entanglement moves towards a question of \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhat if\u201d. It refuses the punctuation of a period to give space for what follows. It is something we must work with outside of pursuits of resolution, and each attempt is one that strives for a better understanding of the richness of the relation. To engage entanglement in this way is a practice of endurance.\n</p><p>Thinking about the questions that you have asked to start this conversation, difference without separability is invested in these spaces of entanglement, or perhaps what Glissant would call a poetics of duration, of relation. This phrase \u201cdifference without separability\u201d comes from Denise Ferreira da Silva\u2019s work. In her article, \u201cOn Difference Without Separability\u201d, da Silva gives a brief history of modern thought through Descartes, Newton, Kant, Cuvier, Boas and Foucault. She traces the ways that these \u201cmodern texts\u201d scientifically image The World as an \u201cordered whole composed of separate parts relating through the mediation of constant units of measurement and/or a limiting violent force\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn235_243-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn235-243\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> This separability is a constitutive component for ushering in modernity by which difference is rendered as fixed and irreconcilable. This negation built upon the overrepresentation of the human as Man, is what upholds the human (body as sovereign property) as a moral figure that necessitates the edgeless violence of enslavement and genocide on those deemed nonhuman or partially human (body as flesh). This separability is a crucial modern text that fixes the present world in a scene of constant reenactment of these violences though the name of the violence has shifted and is proclaimed as national security, sovereignty, austerity, structural adjustment, sanctity of the family, or freedom. In <i>The forgotten past of black computational thought</i>, I speak of an operating system overdetermined by anti-black violence regardless of who the programmer is, I am speaking to the repetition of this logic of separability that is constituted through a justification of violence.\n</p><p>Separability is built upon a kind of racial technoscience. It severs the possibility of relation and masks entanglement in pursuit of the pure. There are only rounded decimals here, they always terminate. Thinking about your interest in \u201cbodies\u201d and the ways that they are rendered and constituted through volumetric digital technologies, this emphasis on separability is germane, as possible bodies become captured into standard fixed units of difference.\n</p><p><b>In hegemonic applications of computation, we see that separation is supposed to function as a neutral, necessary, efficient gesture. Do you think this is how anti-blackness ends up in the bowels of computation? Is it already prefigured in the binary \u201cnature\u201d of computing, not just as a technical basis, but also as an ethics a politics and material culture? Is separation where the coerciveness of computation stems from? And if computation is inherently anti-black, does it make sense to ask it to engage with other lives and relationalities, such as fair algorithms, data justice and infrastructures of care?</b>\n</p><p>I return to this separability because it seems so central for understanding and rethinking both the violences and possibilities for computation. In my prior talk that you referenced, I am trying to make a connection between separability in the da Silvian sense and what David Golumbia calls computationalism. Golumbia makes a distinction between computers and computationalism. For him computationalism \u201cis the view that not just human minds are computers but that mind itself must be a computer\u2014that our notion of intellect is, at bottom, identical with abstract computation\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn236_244-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn236-244\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Computationalism understands cognition itself as inherently a computing process, and by extension, all matters of phenomena in the world can be understood as a function of computation. Thinking about computationalism rather than computing or computation potentially frees the latter from the violences of the former and opens some space for experimentation and reimagining. Computationalism inherits the violences of the modern text that da Silva details. Its central episteme upheld by irreconcilably fixed difference, universal measurements, and separation continues largely undisturbed.\n</p><p><b>How to think about messiness in relation to possible forms of computation? Flesh, complexity and mess are also already-with computation, not before or after data, but somehow simultaneous and constituent of computation and constituent of mess in reciprocity. How could computation and flesh together constitute more livable messes, if at all?</b>\n</p><p>Sketching the shared contours between modernity, and its dependence on black and native violence, and to call it \u201ccomputationalism\u201d perhaps allows for computing to return to a much more expansive capacity that doesn\u2019t always require such violence. This is where I\u2019m interested in speculation and in particular speculative histories, presents, and futures of computation that come out of the political, poetic, and erotic practices of blackness and fugitive fungibility. This thinking thrives in relationship to the work of black queer, trans, feminist scholars and artists such as Hortense Spillers, Sylvia Wynter, C. Riley Snorton, Tiffany Lethabo King, Tina Campt, Saidiya Hartman, Katherine McKittrick, and Marquis Bey. Rather than taking up the body as a site of the liberal human subject imbued with agency, ownership, and stability, these scholars theorize through the flesh and fungibility of blackness. Flesh is distinguished from the body as a result of the unimaginable violence wrought on black people in making them property, unfree laborers, and fungible sites of death, expansion, desire, sensuousness, and commodity. Spillers and King in particular write about the ways in which Black people under capture, conquest, and enslavement were made fungible. They were made into constantly exchangeable resources able to malleably stand in for any needs white colonizers could imagine. While fungibility is born from and determined by continuous violence, Snorton also notices the simultaneous life and possibility even in the shadow of such death. For Snorton fugitive fungibility marks a space of indeterminacy and possibility, which might open other ways of being outside the trappings of the human. This fleshy fungibility is a porous space to inhabit that exists in shared relations to land and other nonhuman and extrahuman others. It is a relation of entanglement. From this place I hope to speculate on different forms of computing that thrive in indeterminacy and work from an ethical relationship of entanglement. Thinking computation from this place works from the assumptions that computation cannot be done away with as a means of addressing violence. It understands that computation is a method, practice, ideology, and episteme. And in its most hegemonic understanding is a very limited form of discourse. As many of the theorists above hold no romances about the extent and saturation of anti-black violence in the modern world, they also tend to the possibilities of life and living that extend beyond that violence. While violence cannot be ignored, it also doesn\u2019t overdetermine life to the extent of rendering it abject and wholly without. I believe it is possible to contend with the violences of computation while simultaneously lingering in the vitality of the flesh. To think and practice computing otherwise as technologies of the flesh that thrive within indeterminacy and interdependency. This is what informs where I think we might look to recover some of these forms. Within my work I look at practices of computation that live in the poetics, politics, erotics, and movements of blackness.\n</p><p><b>Through your studies of the legacies of code, you ask: What if computation engaged with indexing different zones of life, facilitated relationalities other than those of capitalist anti-blackness? Could you say more about the kind of computation this would generate, because you seem to call into question most of all that which is indexed and who is indexing, rather than indexing as a problem in and of itself? The question could also be formulated like this: is there space for attending to volumes technically in their singularity, while not reproducing the exclusions that the very techniques of measuring carry? Or, are there other uses of volumetric techniques that apply separation and indexing, while disassembling those practices from the episteme of exclusion?</b>\n</p><p>As you referenced earlier, my interests in fugitive fungibility informs how I have been thinking about indexing and the database as a potential space to make connections and practice a kind of endured proximity by which we are in relation to that which we index. That we can be in a fungible relationship through porosity. That entanglement is allowed to exist and can be seen as a source for ethical encounter. I suppose this would drastically change how we consider indexing and what we consider indexing to be. Within current hegemonic practices of data capture and indexing the world through measuring, there are certain paradigms that need to be challenged. For me these primarily stem from separability by which measurement simultaneously fixes difference as stable and as irreconcilable. Rather, I believe indexing can hold a different potential when deracinated from this episteme of separability. Instead I think of indexing as a way of accounting for an instance of something. And that because of its shared relations it evades static standardization and is instead in flux and changing. I suppose this gives more texture to the ways that I think about entanglement. Or to be more direct, I believe the benefits of indexing are temporally bounded. They are not absolute nor axiomatic. But I believe indexing can also serve to better emphasize the multiple relations between things in a much more robust way than simply the observable measured differences that scientific rationality often privileges. This form of indexing is malleable and contextual, it depends on the one indexing, the method, and on that which is indexed. Its endured proximity doesn\u2019t seek to remove complications through the rhetoric of universality or transparency, but is invested in the particular and chronic.\n</p><p><b>Computation and life (\u201cbodies\u201d, spaces, relationalities) are already entangled in so many ways; they are mutually constituent, for example the category of life wouldn\u2019t exist without a whole apparatus of segmentation producing it as different from the non-living. To us it feels urgent to think with and towards computing-otherwise rather than to side with the uncomputable or to count on that which escapes calculation. What would it mean to critique math and quantification in their Modern shape, by calling for other logics instead?</b>\n</p><p>In earlier writing, I have returned to theorist and filmmaker Trinh T. Minh-ha\u2019s practice of <i>speaking nearby</i> to illustrate this relationship.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn237_245-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn237-245\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In an interview with Nancy N. Chen for the <i>Visual Anthropology Review</i>, Minh-ha elaborates further: \u201cIn other words, a speaking that does not objectify, does not point to an object as if it is distant from the speaking subject or absent from the speaking place. A speaking that reflects on itself and can come very close to a subject without, however, seizing or claiming it. A speaking in brief, whose closures are only moments of transition opening up to other possible moments of transition\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn238_246-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn238-246\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> I believe this could be an opening potential for indexing and the database, as a temporal marker of an instance of something in relation. What it tells us is not data about the essence of a fixed object, but of something caught in flux that we are in relation to.\n</p><p>I also think this is a place where different practices of computation can be speculated on. To be able engage this type of indexed entanglement, it opens questions of method or protocol. It requires practice. More and more, I stick with computation to describe some of this complexity for a few reasons. The first is in refusing to relinquish computation as an already closed system that no longer requires definition. The second is in acknowledging the economic, cultural, imaginative, and disciplinary power that computation presently holds. And lastly, to speculate on the unique capacity of computation to contend with complex variables and their relationship to flux and modulation.\n</p><p>Speaking on this capacity, \u00c9douard Glissant writes about the trappings and potential that the computer holds towards poetics. In his text, <i>Poetics of Relation</i>, Glissant briefly discusses computation and how it differs from poetry. On this he writes, \u201cAccident that is not the result of chance is natural to poems, whereas it is the consummate vice (the \u201cvirus\u201d) of any self-enclosed system, such as the computer. The poet\u2019s truth is also the desired truth of the other, whereas, precisely, the truth of a computer system is closed back upon its own sufficient logic. Moreover, every conclusion reached by such a system has been inscribed in the original data, whereas poetics open onto unpredictable and unheard of things.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn239_247-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn239-247\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Glissant contrasts computation and poetry focusing on the closed, controlled, and binary character of computationalism. He understands it as a mechanism of separability. However, the potential for the computer when working outside of computationalism is not foreclosed. Just a few pages later he writes, \u201cThe computer, on the other hand, seems to be the privileged instrument of someone wanting to \u201cfollow\u201d any Whole whose variants multiply vetiginously. It is useful for suggesting what is stable within the unstable. Therefore, though it does not create poetry, it can \u2018show the way\u2019 to a poetics.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn240_248-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn240-248\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Because computation is able to contend with complex multiplicity Glissant leaves it open as a wayfinder towards a poetics. He makes a slight but crucial distinction that computation is useful for suggesting what is stable within the unstable. He doesn\u2019t state that computing itself creates stability or static fixed variables, but instead is able to suggest stability as an open and incomplete instance within a field of instability. While his first quote indexes some of the trappings of computation as a closed logic, he follows it by hinting at the possibility for computation to move through the complexities of entanglement. Perhaps at best, computation in this sense can hold the tension of indeterminacy without either becoming paralyzed or reducing the complexity of the Whole into predictable calculable units. Within this slight shift in language, computation is nudged open. It is made porous again and moves towards the direction of a poetics. Perhaps then this porousness can allow for finding a poetics of space within volumetric capture, by underlining the stable and unstable within computation, and resituated computation as a manner and mode of engaging the entanglement between those two poles. It is a practice of \u201cshowing the way\u201d to a relation. Both bodies and space in this mode of computation hold a certain openness. They cannot completely be foreclosed as inherently separable parts.\n</p><p><b>We wondered about the voluminosity of \u201cbodies\u201d but also of entanglement, and how to pay attention to it. Reading Denise Fereirra da Silva\u2019s email conversation with Arjuna Neuman about her use of \u201cDeep Implicancy\u201d rather than \u201centanglement\u201d, we were struck by the relation between spatiality and separation she brings up: \u201cDeep Implicancy is an attempt to move away from how separation informs the notion of entanglement. Quantum physicists have chosen the term entanglement precisely because their starting point is particles (that is, bodies), which are by definition separate in space.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn241_249-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn241-249\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup></b>\n</p><p><b>So what if the spaces of entanglement provide a semiotic-material arena for cohabiting with and practicing 3D computation-otherwise? Could \u201cDeep Implicancy\u201d be where computing otherwise already happens, by means of speculation, indeterminacy and possibility located beyond, or below perhaps, normed actions like capturing, modeling or tracking that are all so complicit with the making of fungibility?</b>\n</p><p>So this question of Deep Implicancy is interesting. I think in reading through da Silva and Neumann\u2019s email exchanges, I have a sense of the difference that she is trying to draw between entanglement and its inherent dependence on a kind of separability, because of its embedded focus on particles inherited from physics. Even things such as quantum entanglement or nonlocality, are still built from some kind of separability. I think that is an important distinction and contribution which breaks open some of my earlier thoughts on entanglement. That being said, I\u2019m not sure I understand Deep Implicancy beyond the ways that it complicates the inherent separability within entanglement. It makes me want to ask, how does Deep Implicancy account for or contend with difference? It seems that there would still need to be room for variation or modulation. Perhaps even modulation and distance can become the language through which to speak to fluctuations, changes, variations, and instances within a dynamic implicancy. Because then we are able to account for difference without flattening it to an equivalence or commensurability. This thinking on modulation and difference is very much informed by Kara Keeling\u2019s work in <i>Queer Times Black Futures</i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn242_250-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn242-250\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> and Abdoumaliq Simone\u2019s work in <i>Improvised Lives: Rhythms of Endurance in an Urban South</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn243_251-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn243-251\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> In her discussion of James A. Snead\u2019s work on Black culture and repetition,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn244_252-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn244-252\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Keeling makes connections to the computational practice of modulation and incommensurability. Evoking Snead, she states, \u201crepetition means that the thing circulates (exactly in the manner of any flow, including capital flows) there in an equilibrium\u201d. The \u201cthing (the ritual, the dance, the beat) is there for you to pick up when you come back to get it\u201d. She argues that this repetition and the ability to return rather than progress allows for a kind of cultural coverage that builds spaces for the unpredictable, errant, and accidental to happen. Keeling sees this practice as a mechanism of modulation, a mode of social and cultural continuity, which does not rely upon commensuration. Instead, it makes \u201cincommensurability\u201d into a relation. Perhaps this incommensurability, the impossibility of neat resolve can provide a helpful language to engage Deep Implicancy and its relationship to difference.\n</p><p><b>The episteme of Modern technosciences classifies \u201cbodies\u201d as entities that occupy the dimensions of space and time at a certain scale, with a certain density, at a certain speed, etc. It is complicit with productivist, segregating, extractivist and deadly aims when calculating volumes of so-called bodies and their surroundings. But maybe such displacements, dimensional and material conditions, could also be of use for a disobedient rearranging of so-called bodies? How to think with possible forms of computation that do not leave its oppressions in place?</b>\n</p><p>Simone picks up this relation of incommensurability and stretches it to describe the movements, motions, calculations, and alterations of bodies as they converge and depart in space. Simone describes these bodies as \u201ctechnical forces\u201d that \u201cspeak, spit, stomp, fuck, gesture, lunge, or hover\u201d. His understanding of space is constructed through these rhythms of endurance that bodies undertake in a constant renegotiation towards \u201ca liveliness of things in general\u201d. For Simone, \u201cendurance also entails the actions of bodies indifferent to their own coherence, where bodies proliferate a churning that staves off death in their extension toward a liveliness of things in general, and where bodies become a transversal technology, as gesture, sex, gathering, and circulation operate as techniques of prolonging\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-253\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-253\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> His writings on bodies as transversal technologies is really intriguing, in that they are always intersecting, crossing, and circulating. In doing so, it creates the spaces that they momentarily inhabit. The space does not precede the bodies. It is not a container in this analysis but is constructed through the circuitous gestures, gatherings, and sex of bodies churning together in incommensurability. Similarly, to Keeling\u2019s focus on repetition Simone offers us a musical lexicon of rhythm, refrain and pulse to find stabilizing moments that thrive in response to risk and incalculability. For Simone the refrain works as this stabilizing repetition that creates \u201ccontexts of operation that cannot be stabilized\u201d. Again, space for Simone is dependent and created through these undulating intersections of bodies that enact open modulating refrains. This works against easy practices of tracking or capturing, that volumetrically rendered spaces require, as it exceeds any preemptive containment. Space for Simone is not predetermined but is interdependent. More importantly, it is interdependent on the relations of bodies that evade stable categorization or coherence. Instead these relations are constantly modulating and shifting. Perhaps most beautifully, Simone articulates these intersecting modulations as care. On this he writes:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>For the intersections among spiraling trajectories are a matter of care<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn245_254-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn245-254\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>, inexplicable care, rogue care, care on the run, a tending not to people or by people, but a care that precedes them. It is a care that makes it possible for residents to navigate the need to submit and exceed, submerge themselves into a darkness in which they are submerged but to read its textures, its tissues, to see something that cannot be seen. It enables them to experience the operations of a sociality besides, right next to the glaring strictures of their obligations, expulsions, and exploitation, something that enables endurance, not necessarily their own endurance as human subjects, but the endurance of care indifferent to whatever or whoever it embraces. This is a process that entails both composition and refusal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn246_255-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn246-255\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup></i></p></blockquote>\n<p>Care here seems to emerge as an ethic void of preconditions. It simply is because it must be. It is a practice of endurance outright. One that enables fugitive flights, the promise of continued evasion, and a relation beyond commensurable equivalences. Perhaps this gives us more texture for what a Deep Implicancy can offer, no longer entangled, but stomping, speaking, and spitting in a space made through care without preconditions, indifferent to quantification.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_14\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Endured_Instances_of_Relation&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn234-242\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn234_242-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Romi Ron Morrison, \u201cSpeaking Nearby: The forgotten past of computational thought\u201d, paper presented at EASSST/4S <i>Conference: Crafting Critical Methodologies in Computing: Theories, Practices and Future Directions,</i> Prague, August 18-21, 2020.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn235-243\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn235_243-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Denise Ferreira da Silva, \u201cOn Difference Without Separability,\u201d in <i>Incerteza Viva: 32nd Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo, </i>ed.

This text is an attempt to show how the consistent contradiction is established, to see the way power gathers around it, to get closer to what drives the circulation of industrial 3D and to describe what is settled as a result.

It is a particular way to arrange volumetrics in the interest of optimized computation, such as drawing hyper-real surfaces on top of extremely simplified structures or the over-reliance on average simulation. We see this eschewed attention for certain complexities and not for others in how simplified color-coded anatomy travels straight from science books into educational software, and biomedical imaging alike. Divisions between tissues and bones based in standardized category systems organize the relation between demarcated elements in polygonal models, which become hard-coded in constrained sets of volumetric operations and predefined time-space settings, affirmed by scientific nomenclature and recognizable color-schemes that are re-used across software applications. As a result, inter-connective body tissues such as fascia are underrepresented in hyper-real 3D renderings. Thus, the less imperative paradigms that recognize fascia as a key participant in body movement are once again occluded by means of optimization, a very specific industrial phenomenon. As an example of evident continuity by the apparent neutrality of a continuous flow of 3D manners, tissue renderings conserve the way things used to <i>look like</i> on 2D anatomy manuals, contributing to the conservation of the way things <i>are</i> in terms of anatomical paradigms.\n</p><p>A second vector at work is the <i>additivist</i> culture of 3D that thrives on relentless forking and versions to be re-visited and taken back.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn256_267-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn256-267\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> 3D computation derives agility from the re-use of particle systems, models, data-structures and data-sets to, for example, render grass, model hair or to detect border crossings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn257_268-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn257-268\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Templates, rigs and scenarios are time-consuming to produce from scratch but once their probable topology is set, 3D assets such as \u201chilly landscape\u201d, \u201cturning screw\u201d, \u201cfirst person shooter\u201d, \u201caverage body\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn258_269-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn258-269\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> or \u201cfugitive\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn259_270-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn259-270\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> start to act as a reserve that can be reused endlessly, adjusted and repeated at industrial scale and without ever depleting. Of course that level of flexibility is designed and maintained under positive values such as agility, efficiency and even diversity, but more often than not, their ongoing circulation leads to extreme normalization. With this, we want to point out the fiction of having many options to grab from, which is precisely the settler illusion of the accessibility of resources to take and run with. It still depends on an economy of <i>asset scarcity</i>, or even worse: an economy of scarcity that bases its sense of technical abundance on a set of finite, regularized elements.\n</p><p>In addition, volumetrics depends more than other screen based environments on normalized viewing interfaces which makes military training sets and viewing environments for biomedical images follow the exact same representational logic. This is where the techno-scientific paradigms of mandatory projections, perspectives, topology based on binary separations between inside and outside, polygonal treatment, Cartesian axes, Euclidean geometries and so forth are being leveraged to relentlessly spread similar techniques across different corners of practice. Polygonal models travel all too easily between applications because their viewing environments are already standardized. Despite the work of feminist visual culture or cubist avantgardes that have made representation a political issue, perspective devices, anatomy theaters or cartographic projection are once again normalized as cultural standards.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn260_271-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn260-271\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The specific manners in which the techno-sciences historically present metrics of volume nest in distinct fields: from spectacle to control, from laboratories to courts of justice, from syllabi to DIY prototypes, from architecture studies to mining pits.

This nauseating and intoxicating setup of variability and rigidity produces the establishment of a universal mono-culture of 3D.\n</p><p>To highlight the continuity of normalizing forces, is our way to critically signal a globalized technocratic behavior based on the accumulation of sameness and repetition, rather than one attuned to the radical, mutating and interconnected specificity of something as wide and multi-modal as the volume of differentiated bodies. 3D models seemingly travel with ease, and this particular easiness facilitates the erasure of politics and the reaffirmation of a central norm. It means the patriarchocolonial linear representation of measurable volumes ends up with providing only with sometimes modular, sometimes fungible entities, circulated by and circulating the everlasting convenience of Modern canons.

These paradigms have been assimilated and naturalized to such an extent that they each lost their own history and have become inseparable from each other, interlocking in ways that have everything to do with the way they support the Modern project.

We can see all sorts of 3D devices and standards circulating in a continuous current from one industry to another, but they persistently move towards a re-establishment of the same, both in terms of shape and of value. Our aim is to understand the paradigms they keep carrying along, and to attend to the assumptions, delegations and canons they impose over matter and semiotics when keeping their business as usual. We suspect there is a rigidification in the establishment of what circulates and what doesn\u2019t and we need to see where that persistence hangs from, and how it came to be settled. What are the cultural logics underlying 3D technologies, that turn them into a rigid regime?\n</p><p>One key aspect of the very specific settling of 3D, is that they settle in flow. It is through use and reuse that the establishment of values and manners gets reinforced. A kind of technocratic sedimentation of protocols, standards, tools and formulas which leaves a trace of what is possible in the circuit of volumetrics. The behavior of this sedimentation implies that things just happen again because they happened already before. Every time a tool is adopted from one industry into another, an edge is re-inscribed in the spectrum of what is possible to do with it. And every time the same formula is applied, its axiom gets strengthened. This ongoing settling of the probable in volumetrics comes with its own worlding: it scaffolds the very material-semiotics of what world is to be done, by whom, and by what means. If software making is indeed worldmaking, the settlement of volumetric toolkits and technoscientific paradigms affects what worlds we can world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn267_278-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn267-278\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For those of us who feel affected by the Cartesian anxiety of always feeling backward<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn268_279-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn268-279\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> in a damaging axiomatic culture of assemblage and measure-all-this-way, it is important to make explicit the moves that reified what it ended up being: an exteriority-less industrial regime based on scientific truths that are being produced by that same regime. It is evident that volume counts a lot in how it came to ostent value, but how does it count and how is it counted? Was it the car industry, that settled values and forms before the Lego blocks appeared? Was it the Lego paradigm of assemblage, that was settled as a reference for biomedical researchers to use it for the predictions in their screens and speeches? The befores and afters matter in this bedrock of shapes and values, as they are telling for what is probably going to happen next.\n</p><p>Over the years, we detected a number of sedimenting behaviors or volumetric probables. The first is <i>externalizing implications</i>. The outsourcing of labour and responsibilities is ubiquitous in most industrial computing, but takes a specific shape in the industrial continuum of 3D. Through a strictly hierarchical mode of organization, tasks, roles and all labour-related configurations of relationality persistently, the command is kept in the hands of a privileged minority. Their agendas set industrial priorities but without committing to specific fields or areas of application, therefore avoiding all liability. This adds up to an outsourcing of responsibilities to less powerful agents, such as confronting users with just Yes/No options for agreeing with terms and conditions, or the delegation of energetic costs to the final end of the supply chain.\n</p><p>The need for dealing with computational complexity when rendering volumetrics, leads to an over-reliance on socio-technical standards and protocols that become increasingly hard to undo. <i>Rigging simplification</i> refers to the obfuscated reduction inherent in particle systems, for example. A limited set of small samples or \u2018sprites\u2019 is randomized in order to suggest endless complexity. Another example is the way inside and outside is plotted through polygon meshes in CAD files. This technique produces a faster rendering but settles a paradigm of binary separation between interior and exterior worlds. The same goes for the normalized logics of rendering graphics with the help of ray-tracing techniques that demand planar projection for resolving a smooth move between 2D and 3D.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn269_280-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn269-280\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><i>Convenient universalism</i> is how we refer to the way volumetrics technically facilitate modes that avoid dissent, that do not stay with complexity or how all matter becomes equally volumetric before the eyes of the 3D-scanner. Because a virtual dungeon can be rendered with the help of ray-tracing, do the same representational conventions actually apply to dead trees, human brains, aquifers, rhinoceroses and plant-roots? Convenient universalism does not bother to include nuances of minoritarian proposals in mainstream industrial development. It allows ongoing violence to take shape as reasonable, and common sense.\n</p><p>Then, there is the sedimentation of <i>persistent hyper-realities</i>. The Continuum operates well when aligning so-called truths, with systems of verification, and performing objectivity. It is not a surprise that it is at ease with Modern scientific and cultural paradigms; its values and assumptions co-construct each other. This is both confirmed and suggested by the over-presence of tools for segmentation and foreground-background separation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn270_281-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn270-281\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>And last but not least, we can speak of <i>streamlined aesthetics</i> as a sedimented behavior. It can be confirmed that as the continuum circulates, the aesthetics of tools and their outcomes flatten. The same operations hide behind layers that look the same. Similar procedures are offered by devices that look alike. WYSIWYG interfaces were smoothly adjusted to the machinery of measuring volumes for any purpose... and what sediments in that process is just a sharp similarity all the way along. The aesthetic canon involves equilibrated proportions, hyperrealism and an evident optimization of rendering maneuvers.\n</p><p>The cultural logic of 3D is tied to the ongoing settlement of a legacy of standardization, but also to a history of converging the presences of hugely diversified entities under a rigid regime. This volumetric regime is sustained by vivid Modern techniques, vocabularies, infrastructures and protocols. Or to put it bluntly: the calculation of what it takes to count via the x, y and z axes depends on modes that are far from neutral, and of course are not innocent. The technoscience of volumetrics was settled while being already entangled with a whole world in and of its own.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Possible_Continuums_of_3D\">The Possible Continuums of 3D</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=The_Industrial_Continuum_of_3D&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the previous sections we spent some time unpacking how 3D circulates through its industrial continuum and what is sedimented as a result. We clarified what needs to be radically changed or directly abolished to get at a possible volumetrics that can happen non-industrially or at least is less marked by industrial, solutionist values. As we have seen, the industrial continuum of 3D settles and flows in particular ways, making its way through business as usual. It\u2019s self-fulfilling moves produce increasingly normed worlds that are continued along the axes of the probable. In this last section, we would like to see what other forms of volumetric continuation, circulation and settlement might be quite possible, as a way to world differently. To find another \u201chow\u201d that can stay with complexity and will not negate, facilitate or altogether erase other modes of existence, we\u2019ll need to reorient 3D from a trans*feminist perspective, and move obliquely towards 3D that can go otherwise.\n</p><p>Could an ethics and politics committed to volumetric complexity emerge from reverse-engineering the ebbs and flows of industrial affection? Our first task is to rescue <i>continuity</i> from the claws of the established, the normed and the Modern. Against the unbearable persistence of 3D, discontinuity, latency and un-settlement are evident counterforces only as long as they engage with resisting that which 3D settles by flow: neoliberal accumulation, colonial commercial normativity and one-directionality. An affirmative volumetrics does not reject or dismiss the power of volumetrics as a whole, or give up on continuity altogether either. As Donna Haraway asks in conversation with Cathy Wolfe: \u201cHow can we truly learn to compose rather than decry or impose?\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn271_282-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn271-282\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>We compiled a list of proposals for what we suspect are more affirmative ways, suggestions for dealing with the \u201cvolumetric probables\u201c that emerged from our research endeavor so far. They are proposals which are each \u201cnothing short of a radical shift in how we approach matter and form\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn272_283-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn272-283\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> What is important to keep in mind, is that <i>none of these are in fact impossible to implement</i>, so come on!\n</p><p><b>Remediating Cartesian anxiety</b>: What if we decide to use six instead of four axes, twelve instead of three or zero instead of n? What if we take time to get used to multiple paradigms for orientation, instead of settling for only one regime? Letting go of the finite coordinates of x, y, z and t could be a first step to break with the convenient reductions of parallel and perpendicular assumptions. It\u2019s implementations might require rigorous inventions with a transdisciplinary attitude, but we can afford them if what is at stake is to re-orient volumetrics for non-coercive uses, right?\n</p><p><b>Paranodes to ever-polygonal worlds</b>: By paying attention to the paranodal in ever-polygonal worlds, the simplistic dominance of node-centricity might quickly shift to entirely different topological articulations.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn273_284-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn273-284\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> This would allow other imaginations of relationality, this time not along the vectors of sameness and similarity but emerging from the undefined materiality of what\u2019s there, and what was underrepresented by paradigmatic techno-sciences.\n</p><p><b>Extra-planar projections</b>: If the distance between 3D and 2D was not to be crossed quickly and straight, but allowed for curves, meanders and loops, then a whole technoscience of dissimilarity and surprise collinearity would emerge. We know the cartographies of complexity are already there, but we just have been lacking the means for their representation, their analysis and their use. Such extra-planar projections would intervene the world with a realm of possibilities in the in-between of 2D and 3D, not assuming the axioms of linear projection but rather convoking the playful articulations of elements diffracted inwards, detailing a scape of situated 2.1D, 2.5.3SD, 2.7Dbis and 2.999999D. The cartographic computation of the possible then becomes a latent one of unsolved folds, abrupt edges, unfinished integers and inaccurate parallels.\n</p><p><b>Multi-dimensional depth</b>: What background-foreground mergings can we invent for the multidimensional analysis of deep matterings besides volumetrics? Matter is not volume so we need other arrangements of depth and density than the calculating measurings of dimensional worlds. Switching, blurring and blending what comes to the fore with what usually stays behind declutches attention from the binary back-front and inside-outside divides, thickness becomes an area in need of subtle study and nuanced formulations. When the surveillance camera is turned onto the policeman, violence does not go away. But there might be ways to hold paths and crossings in mutual affection and radical sustainability. If capturing would be about soLiDARity instead of policing, about flourishing instead of conservation, about density instead of profiling then fights for social justice might have a chance to reclaim the very dimensions where mundane violence is executed on a daily basis..\n</p><p><b>Fits-and-starts-volumetrics:</b> Which transformative moves can hold time beyond constant speed, agile advancement and smooth gait? As we learned from Heather Love and her understanding of queer life as constantly feeling backward,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn274_285-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn274-285\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> as well as from from crip technosciences:<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn275_286-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn275-286\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> linear time is a problematic norm that will always confirm and appreciate what goes forward. In any case, Possible Volumetrics can not be aligned with it. Time as mattered through computation (4D) works too hard on appearing continuous. We propose to use that energy for flowing with what gets crooked and throttled, to move with the flutters and stotterings. Along this text, we tried to show the continuous problematic of the industrialization of 3D, in order to convoke a possible volumetrics that could do 3D otherwise.\n</p><p>In case these proposals feel too hard or even impossible to implement, remember that this sense is always the effect of hegemony! Abolishing the Industrial Continuum of 3D means to place it at the eccentric core of a kind of computing that dares to world without patriarcho-capitalist and colonial structures holding it up.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:802px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_stuttgart.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/4/4d/Continuum_stuttgart.JPG/800px-Continuum_stuttgart.JPG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/4/4d/Continuum_stuttgart.JPG/1200px-Continuum_stuttgart.JPG 1.5x, /images/thumb/4/4d/Continuum_stuttgart.JPG/1600px-Continuum_stuttgart.JPG 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_stuttgart.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Industrial Continuum of 3D emerges during \u201cCollective inventorying\u201d, Akademie Schloss Solitude, Stuttgart, 2017</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:802px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_recto.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/b/b6/Continuum_recto.png/800px-Continuum_recto.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"566\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/b/b6/Continuum_recto.png/1200px-Continuum_recto.png 1.5x, /images/b/b6/Continuum_recto.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_recto.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\u201c<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://possiblebodies.constantvzw.org/inventory/?074\">The Industrial Continuum of 3D</a>\u201d, fanzine, Barcelona, 2017</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:802px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_barcelona_1.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Continuum barcelona 1.png\" src=\"/images/thumb/9/90/Continuum_barcelona_1.png/800px-Continuum_barcelona_1.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/9/90/Continuum_barcelona_1.png/1200px-Continuum_barcelona_1.png 1.5x, /images/9/90/Continuum_barcelona_1.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_barcelona_1.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:802px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_barcelona_2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/4/43/Continuum_barcelona_2.png/800px-Continuum_barcelona_2.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/4/43/Continuum_barcelona_2.png/1200px-Continuum_barcelona_2.png 1.5x, /images/4/43/Continuum_barcelona_2.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_barcelona_2.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Exploring the continuum with participants in \u201cImagined Mishearings,\u201d Hangar (Barcelona, 2017)</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:802px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_brighton.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/6/64/Continuum_brighton.png/800px-Continuum_brighton.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"566\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/6/64/Continuum_brighton.png/1200px-Continuum_brighton.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/6/64/Continuum_brighton.png/1600px-Continuum_brighton.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Continuum_brighton.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A diagram of The Industrial Continuum of 3D for the workshop \u201cContinuous corpo-realities &lt;-&gt; diagramming probabilities and possibilities!\u201d, University of Sussex, Brighton, 2018</div></div></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_15\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=The_Industrial_Continuum_of_3D&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-6\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn246-256\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn246_256-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\u201cItem 125: Disappearing around us,\u201d <i>The Possible Bodies Inventory</i>.

They integrate 3D-scanning, -modeling, -tracking and -printing into optimised systems for dealing with \u201cplants\u201d as volume. Botanical data processing techniques make up a natureculture continuum that increasingly defines the industrial topology applied to the existence of so-called plants.\n</p><p>Thinking along the agency of cultural artifacts that capture and co-compose 3D polygon, pointcloud and other techniques for volumetric calculation, the Possible Bodies Inventory contains over a hundred items. For this text we brought together manuals, mathematical concepts, artworks and images of so-called plants in their situated computational ecologies of practice as a way to wonder about the volumetric presence of so-called plants. We write \u201cso-called plants\u201d because we want to problematize the limitations of the ontological figure \u201cplant\u201d and the isolation it implies. It is a way to question the various methods whereby finite, specified and discrete entities are being made to represent the characteristics of whole species, erasing the nuances of very particular beings. We are wondering about the way in which computational renderings of so-called plants reconfirm the figure-background divide that Andrea Ballestero discusses in her study of the socio-environmental behavior of aquifers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn282_292-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn282-292\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> This not only happens through the default computational gestures of separation and segmentation, but also by the way cycles of flourishing, growing, pollinating, nurturing of \u201cplants\u201d appear animated while being technically suspended in time. Such divisions and fixities are the result of a naturalization process that managed to determine \u201cplants\u201d as clearly demarcated individuals or entities, arranged on landscapes along which their modes of existence develop under predictable and therefore controllable conditions. It is this production-oriented mode that 3D volumetrics seem to reproduce.\n</p><p>The Possible Bodies Inventory is itself undeniably part of a persistently colonial and productivist practice. The culture of the inventory is rooted in the material origins of mercantilism and deeply intertwined with the contemporary data-base-based cosmology of techno-colonialist turbo-capitalism.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn283_293-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn283-293\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Inventorying is about a logi(sti)cs of continuous updates and keeping items available, potentially going beyond pre-designed ways of doing and being proposed by the mono-cultures of what we refer to as \u201ctotalitarian innovation\u201d, and what Donna Haraway might call \u201cinformatics of domination\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn284_294-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn284-294\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> In line with botanic gardens, genetic notebooks and Latin nomenclatures, an inventory can be understood as a workspace arranged for constant managerial return, accessibility and \u2014 in contrast with a collection or an archive \u2014 the easy replacement of items.

Disobedient action-research implies radical un-calibration from concrete types of knowledge and hence proposes a playful, unorthodox and \u2018inventive\u2019 inhabiting of many disciplines, of learning, unlearning and relearning on the go.

The object has nothing and everything to do with so-called plants, as the low-res camera never went through a machinic training process to distinguish or separate leaves. The software processing the data-points then algorithmically renders the vegetation with an <i>invented</i> outside membrane, a kind of outer petal or connective tissue that is sneaked into the modeling stage and is finally made through the printing device. This invention might look hallucinatory to the eyes of a trained botanist, but for us it is a reminder of the need to re-attune digital tools in a non-anthropocentric manner. Pascale printed the volumetric file at the maximum scale of the 3D printer she had available, breaking the promise of the 1:1 relationship between scanned object and its representation. Because she did not remove the scaffolding that upheld the soft plastic threads during the printing process, these now \u201cuseless\u201d elements flourish as twigs once the object had solidified. The item talks to us about a complex switching of agencies: that of the vegetal groupings that defy linear, isolating and rigid topological axioms nested in the operations of 3D optics and also that of algorithmic renders, operating with a logic that simultaneously defies the <i>realistic</i> establishment of space that is kept for plants as affordable, accountable, nameable, determined, discrete entities.\n</p><p>In the way \u201cplants\u201d have been historically described, there is an ongoing attempt to fix the zones where they actually can be, become and belong. But looking closely, we can easily identify paranodal spaces in-between the vegetal and other forms of existence, gaps or porous membranes which exist beyond the positive space of nodes and links . These can be seen as void and sterile spaces in-between known entities, but they can also be taken as wide open, inhabitable areas; places to be in-relation that are non-neutral and also not innocent at all: connecting surfaces that provide with the blurring travel from one isolated unit of life onto another, in specific ways. Holes, gaps or even chasms are zones of the world in and for themselves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn289_300-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn289-300\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Mel Chen\u2019s work on toxicity and affect tries to come to terms with the way interspecies interabsorbence is prefigured by power relations, and through it we can see how the attempt to separate, segment, identify and onto-epistemologically demarcate sharp edges must be considered as a damage due to the persistent cutting apart of dense and complex relational worlds that as a result do not show cracks as inhabitable any more. How those damaging representations infuse the contemporary computational take on \u201cplants\u201d is a direct consequence of Modern technosciences and their utilitarian/exploitative foundations, based on the fungibility of some matters and the extraction of others. But if we think of seeds blown by the wind, roots merged with minerals or branches grabbing the whole world around them... formerly disposable cracks and gaps also have lively potential for ongoingness, as areas for circulating matters. From useless to blossoming, from separating border to articulated and activated crack, we need \u201ccircluding\u201d moves of agency that are difficult but not impossible to uphold in computed spaces.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn290_301-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn290-301\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Image2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Image2.png\" src=\"/images/thumb/e/ee/Image2.png/400px-Image2.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/e/ee/Image2.png/600px-Image2.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/e/ee/Image2.png/800px-Image2.png 2x\" /></a></div>\n<p><b>Item 102: Grassroot rotation</b>\n</p>\n<pre>Author(s): <b>RooTrak</b>\nEntry date: <b>2 July 2018</b>\nCluster(s) the item belongs to: <b>Segmentation</b>\nImage: Segmentation of a tomato root from clay loam using RooTrak, screenshot<sup id=\"cite_ref-302\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-302\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</pre>\n<p><i>En nuestros jardines se preparan bosques</i> (\u201cIn Our Gardens, Forests Are Being Prepared\u201d) is a thick para-academic publication on political potential by Rafael S\u00e1nchez-Mateos Paniagua, alluding to the force of potentiality that is specific to vegetal surfaces, entities and co-habituating species which turns them into powerful carriers of political value.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn291_303-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn291-303\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Other than productive and extractive, they are informative of the inner functionings, inter-dependencies and convivial delicacies with so-called plants.\n</p><p><i>Item 102: Grassroot rotation</i> is a poetic rendering of demo-videos that accompany a manual for RooTrak, a software-suite for the automated recovery of three-dimensional plant root architecture from X-Ray microcomputed tomography images. The images we see rotating before us are the result of a layered process of manual and digital production, starting with separating a grass \u201cplant\u201d from it\u2019s connected, rhizomatic neighbours. In that sense, it is a computationally gardened object. The \u201cplant\u201d is grown in a small, cylindrical container filled with extracted soil before being placed in a micro-CT installation and exposed to X-rays. The resulting data is then calibrated and rendered as a 3D image, where sophisticated software processes are used to demarcate the border between soil and root, coloring those vessels that count as root in blood red. The soil fades out in the background.\n</p><p>In collaboration with RooTrak, the software package responsible for these images, X-ray microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT) promise access to the living structure through \u201ca nondestructive imaging technique that can visualize the internal structure of opaque objects.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn292_304-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn292-304\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> But these quantified roots are neither growing nor changing. They rotate endlessly in a loop of frozen or virtual time, which can be counted and at the same time not. It passes through time while the loop goes on smoothly... but it does not pass at all in relation to what happens to the looped matter of the represented root. Speed and direction are kept constant and stable, providing with an illusion of permanence and durability that directly links this re-presentational practice to the presentational practice of cabinets, jars and frames. The use of animation has been persistent in the scientific study of life, as a pragmatic take on \u201cgiving life\u201d or technically re-animating life-forms before the eyes of other students. After first having claimed the ability to own and reproduce life by determining what differentiates life from non-life, all of this is done in an efficient manner and with a focus on positivist optimization. But how does the 3D animation complex apparatus do the trick of determining life and non-life? While RooTrak prefers to contrast its particular combination of CT-imaging and 3D-rendering with \u201cinvasive\u201d techniques such as root-washing or growing roots in transparent agar, to us this grassroot rotation seems closer to the practice of fixing, embalming and displaying species in formaldehyde.\n</p><p>The tension between animism and animation can be studied from the dimension of time and its specific technocultural maneuvers present in <i>Item 102</i>. It helps us see how computed representations of the animated vegetable kingdom continues to contribute to the establishment of hierarchies in living matter. What are the consequences of using techniques that isolate entities which need complex networks for their basic existence?

He quotes Geoffrey Winthrop-Young to highlight how elemental \u201cagriculture [...] is initially not a matter of sowing and reaping, planting and harvesting, but of mapping and zoning, of determining a piece of arable land to be cordoned off by a boundary that will give rise to the distinction between the cultivated land and its natural other\u201d. Gil-Fournier continues: \n</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, this initial two-dimensional demarcation gives rise to a practice that can be further understood when the many vertical layers that exist simultaneously above and below the ground start to be considered. From the interaction of synthetic nutrients in the soil with the roots of the plants, to the influence of weather or the effect of both human and machinic labour, agriculture appears as a volumetric activity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn299_314-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn299-314\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>\n<p>The inclusion of such massive vertical management of soil with the aim of fertilizing it, reorients agriculture from a question of surface to the affections of scaling up-and-down the field. To explain the way soil matter is turned into a \u201clegible domain\u201d, Gil-Fournier takes as a case study the Spanish \u201cinner colonization\u201d that organized land and landscapes for plantation and irrigation. Through those studies, it is made materially explicit how the irrigation zones configure a network-like shape of polygonal meshes that distribute and systematize the territory for a sophisticated exploitation of its vegetal potentials. In Francoist Spain, under a totalitarian regime of autocracy, inner colonization was the infrastructural bet to provide the nationalist project with all needed resources from within, as well as with a confident step into the developmentist culture of wider Western, Modern economies. The media-archaeology perspective that is activated in Gil-Fournier\u2019s work, facilitates a departure point for a study of the legacies carried by contemporary hypercomputational applications that are currently being tested to, for example, analyze the seasonal evolution of gigantic agro-operations or to detect the speed by which desertification revealsthe diminishing of so-called green areas.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn300_315-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn300-315\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Recent space imaging developments have given rise to a spread of commercial services based on the temporal dimensions of satellite imagery.

Luft was looking for a \u201csample scene\u201d for his work on digitally emulated watercolor renderings: \u201cI was thinking of something complex, filled with vegetation \u2014 like trees overgrown with ivy. Fortunately I was able to implement a procedural system so that the ivy would grow by itself. The result is a small tool allowing a virtual ivy to grow in your 3d world.\u201d 10 years later, we find Luft\u2019s rudimentary code back as the Ivy Generator add-on which can be installed into Blender, a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software suite. The manual for IvyGen add-on read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. Select the object you want to grow ivy on.\n</p><p>2. Enter Edit Mode and select a vertex that you want the ivy to spawn from.\n</p><p>3. Snap the cursor to the selected vertex.\n</p><p>4.

The slippage might possibly seem banal because computational vocabulary already naturalize vegetal terms such as tree, root, branching, seeds and so on to such an extent that the phrase \u201cSelect the object you want to grow ivy on\u201d at first causes no alarm. It is common in modeling environments to blend descriptions of so-called bodies with those of their fleshy counterparts. This normalized dysphoria is considered a short-cut without harm, a blurring of worlds that does not signal any real confusion or doubt of what belongs to what. The use of \u201cplant\u201d when \u201cso-called plant\u201d would be more accurate, effectuates a double-sided holding in place, that ignores the worlding power of modeling so-called ivy in computation, and removes the possibility for these ivies to make a difference.\n</p><p>Non-computational ivy is a clear example of <i>symbiogenesis</i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn304_320-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn304-320\">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> meaning that it is materially, structurally and behaviorally always-already implicated in co-dependence with other structures, vegetal or not, straight or crooked, queer or dead. But the vegetal modeling in IvyGen takes another route. So-called Plants are drawn from one single starting point that then are modulated according to different computed forces. Parameters allow users to modulate its primary direction of expansion (the weighted average of previous expansion directions), add a random influence, simulate an adhesion force towards other objects, add an up-vector imitating the phototropy of so-called plants, and finally simulate gravity. The desire and confidence by which this procedural system makes Ivy \u201cgrow\u201d itself, is not innocent. Technically, Ivy Gen implements a Fibonacci sequence complexified by external forces that act as \u201cdeviators\u201d, and variation is the result of a numerical randomization applied after-the-fact. The Fibonacci sequence is a string of numbers that describes a spiral that mathematician Fibonacci coined as \u201cgolden proportions\u201d. These proportions can allegedly also be found in biological settings such as: tree branching, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern, and the arrangement of a pine cone\u2019s bracts. It became a pet project for nature lovers, math enthusiasts and 3D-modellers who create an ongoing stream of more or less convincing computer programs and visualizations that celebrate algorithmic botany or computational phylotaxy. The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical construct that has just the right combination of scientific street cred, spiritual promise and eloquent number wizardry to convincingly bring patterns in \u2018nature\u2019 in direct relation to math and computation, confirming over and over again that aesthetics and symmetry are synonymous and that simple rules can have complex consequences. \u201cPlant\u201d patterns are not just beautiful but they are inevitable. They can be decoded like computer programs, and isn\u2019t computation as stunning as nature itself?<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn305_321-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn305-321\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Like in many other modeling set-ups for simulating biological life, IvyGen aligns 3D computation with phyllotaxy without reservations. It constructs so-called plants as autonomous individuals through applying expansion pattern of which the \u201cprimary growth direction\u201d is straight at the core. This is not surprising because the procedural conditionings of computation seem to make certain political fictions of life which provoke technocratic and scientific truths of so-called bodies more easy to implement than others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn306_322-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn306-322\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> IvyGen re-asserts a non-symbiogenetic understanding of evolution and ecology where growth is a deformation of the symmetrical, a deviation after the fact. Queer angles can only arrive afterwards and are always figured as disruption, however benign and supposedly in the interest of convincing realism. Luft clarifies that \u201cthe goal was not to provide a biological simulation of growing ivy but rather a simple approach to producing complex and convincing vegetation that adapts to an existing scene\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn307_323-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn307-323\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> The apparent modesty of the statement confirms that even if the goal has not been to simulate non-computational ivy, the procedural system is seen as a \u201csimplified\u201d approach to actual biological growth patterns, rather than an approach that conceptually and politically differs from it. The point is not to correct IvyGen to apply other procedures, but to signal that the lack of problematization around that rote normalization is deeply problematic in and of itself.\n</p>\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Image6.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Image6.png\" src=\"/images/thumb/1/15/Image6.png/400px-Image6.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/1/15/Image6.png/600px-Image6.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/1/15/Image6.png/800px-Image6.png 2x\" /></a></div>\n<p><b>Item 120: Simulated dendrochronology for demographics?</b>\n</p>\n<pre>Author(s) of the item: <b>Pedro Cruz, John Wihbey, Avni Ghael, Felipe Shibuya</b>\nYear: <b>2017-2018</b>\nEntry date: <b>18 September 2020</b>\nImage: Tailoring X-ray imaging techniques for dendrochronology of large wooden objects, screenshot<sup id=\"cite_ref-324\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-324\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>\n</pre>\n<p>Dendrochronologist study climate and atmospheric conditions during different periods based on tree-ring growth in wood.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn308_325-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn308-325\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> This particular scientific way to relate to life has to be individual-centered in order to make trees emerge in their ideal form.

Instead of departing from a complex environment full of forces interlaced in the midst of which a tree grows, dendrochronology reads the aberrations and deviations from the geometrical circle as exceptional interventions deforming its concentric expansion, and by doing so re-confirms/projects the idealized geometry time and time again as the desired centered and equilibrated life-pattern for a tree.

In other words: the horizontal strata of tree rings present a specific worlding, while the disciplinary study of them brings to their complex and rich wording comparative and quantitative methods that overimpose a view of what ought to be, an average behavior as well as a distance of that specimen from an ideal representation of its species. How could dendrochronology inform on difference, instead of imposing ideals, inviting the probable and avoiding forgiving comparisons of nation-state demographics as if it was \u201cresembling a living organism\u201d, only subjected to climate inclemencies? The worrying benevolence in the data visualization work, trying to naturalize immigration via the <i>greenwashing</i> figuration of a tree trunk cut, helps us keep alert when encountering this kind of technocultural leaps.

First, what are the cracks in the apparatus of contemporary 3D that are too-often presented as seamless. How and where can those cracks be found and signaled, named and made traceable? Second, how can we provoke and experience a flourishing of volumetric computation otherwise, attentive to its implicancies and its potential to widen the possible? In <i>Vegetal volumetrics</i>, those surfaces that provide bridges for jumping from one unit of life to another, are made tangible in <i>Item 033: This obscure side of sweetness is waiting to blossom</i>. <i>Item 102: Grassroot rotation</i> exposed the consequences of contrasting life and non-life all too graphically.

In our technocultures of critique, it is not rare at all to share the views on \u201cof course, those techniques are not neutral\u201d. Nevertheless, after studying the tricks and tips of volumetrics (from biomedicine, to mining, to sports or to court), we understood that once these complex worlds entangle with computation, the normalized assumptions of Cartesian optimization start to dominate and overrule. The cases we keep in the Possible Bodies inventory are each rather banal, far from exceptional and even everyday. They show that volumetrics are embedded in very mundane situations, but once folded into computation, concerns are easily dismissed. It shows the monocultural power of the probable, as a seemingly non-violent regulator of that what is predictable and therefore proportional, reasonable and efficient. The probable is an adjective turned into a noun, a world oriented by probabilistic vectors, in the socioeconomic sense of the \u201cnormal\u201d. We are committed to heightening sensibility for the actual violence of such normality, in order to start considering variable forms to open up cracks for computational cultures that flourish by and for other means. By keeping complexity close, the possible becomes doable.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_16\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=So-called_Plants&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-6\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn277-287\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn277_287-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Fang Fang Gao, Longsheng Fu, Xin Zhang, Yaqoob Majeed, Rui Li, Manoj Karkee, Qin Zhang, \u201cMulti-class fruit-on-plant detection for apple in SNAP system using Faster R-CNN,\u201d <i>Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</i>, 176 (2020).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn278-288\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn278_288-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Eckart Lange, Sigrid Hehl-Lange, \u201cIntegrating 3D Visualisation in Landscape Design and Environmental Planning,\u201d GAIA Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society 15, no. 3 (2006).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-ftn279-289\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-ftn279_289-0\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Dieter Fritsch, Martin Kada, \u201cVisualisation using game engines,\u201d <i>Archiwum ISPRS</i> 35.

Kym works at Bidston Observatory Artistic Research Centre in Liverpool, a place that has historically been occupied by different research-led organizations \u2014 up to now, predominantly in the Natural Earth Sciences.<sup id=\"cite_ref-330\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-330\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Originally built to measure time, latitude and the declination of the stars, in later iterations employees worked with meteorological, tidal and other marine data. Following this lineage from astronomical observation, to maritime scoping and charting, she became interested in the techno-political history of tidal prediction and started to study together with researchers from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC). In the following transcript, Kym explains us what is at stake in this work, and how it is structured.</b>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"An_area_of_interest_that_needs_focus\">An area of interest that needs focus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the models that are used to run massive data sets, to do predictions for earth sciences or for meteorology or oceanography, there is an area of interest that needs to be focused on, because you can\u2019t collect and process all data. For example, if you\u2019re trying to figure out what waves will occur in a seascape, you need some edges to the object that you\u2019re looking at.\n</p><p>The issue with creating edges is that they just stop, that they make something finite, and things are often not finite. Waves have no edges and they don\u2019t just end. So, if you\u2019re trying to figure out different conditions for one area, a year in advance, you are going to have to figure out what comes in and what goes out of this imaginary realm. This is why you need what are called \u201copen boundary conditions\u201d: the mathematics that are applied to hundreds of sets of variables that create the <i>outside</i> of that model in order for it to run.\n</p><p>There are a lot of different ways to create outside boundary conditions, and there are various kinds of equations that, in all honesty, are above my head. There are differential equations depending on what your object is, and if you\u2019re looking at waves, then you will use elliptic and hyperbolic equations.\n</p><p>The issue comes when you need to run two different kinds of data sets. You need to understand what wind is going to do to waves, for example. And if you need to know that, you are going to involve both the ocean model and the atmosphere model, which are on some level incompatible. The atmosphere model has many more data points than the ocean, something like at a ratio of 1000 to 1. What that means is that it is so much more fine grained than the ocean model, so they cannot simply be run together, for every time that there is one step of the ocean model, there is a thousand steps for the atmosphere model to run through. The open boundary conditions need to provide the sets of conditions that will allow for these models to be integrated at massively different scales. That is one example.\n</p><p>This term, \u201copen boundary conditions\u201d, makes sense to me, because of the gathering and gleaning that I have been doing across different disciplines, knowing that the vocabularies and discipline-specific words I am using will be warped, and perhaps not have the same equations applied to them. But coming from critical media theory, or philosophy of technology, and then moving to applied sciences is going to produce some interesting differences in timescales and steps. The reason I\u2019m talking about this at all, is that I landed at Bidston Observatory Artistic Research Centre, and this was formerly a place for astronomical observation. From astronomical observation it moved to tidal research and then prediction and charting. The history of the observatory as a part of the artistic research centre, which it is now, leads you to the kinds of data visualizations that are produced by modeling and data collection, and the discipline of oceanography as a whole.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modelling_Waves_and_Swerves\">Modelling Waves and Swerves</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><i>Modelling Waves and Swerves</i> started off as a dusty scrabble around the basements.<sup id=\"cite_ref-331\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-331\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> I was excited to find original IBM 1130 data punch cards, which had been used in tidal prediction. But this soon turned into scratching my head over the harmonic calculations of tidal prediction machines, and I needed more help to understand these. And so, with collaborators, we set up <i>Modelling Waves and Swerves</i> \u2014 an ongoing series of weekend work sessions. In our initial call-out, we beckoned to \u201cmarine data modellers, tired oceanographers, software critics and people concerned with the politics of predictive visualizations\u201d. The tiredness was not a typo \u2014 it was intended as a mode of approach, of care, for the limits of a discipline; and to navigate between the steps of data collection, prediction and dispersal of climate change data. Repetitive conclusions of ocean warming and sea level rising are regularly released, and when these meet the reception from wider publics, which can sometimes at best be described as indifferent, surely scientists must be a little weary?\n</p><p>So these work sessions take place in the observatory, which was formerly occupied by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), and sits just outside of Liverpool, in the UK. The group looks at current and historical processes of data collection, assimilation and computational modelling of oceanographic data sets, on the way to their visual outputs \u2014 and these chronologically range from ink blotted wavy lines on a drum of paper, to hyper-real 3D renderings.\n</p><p>The types of data visualizations we find now, are 3D ocean current models, or colour variated global warming indices. If we are asking about the looseness of attachment between data visualization and energetic response, and why there is so little real response to those snippish heat stripes, then in an appeal to ethics and behavioural change, it might be useful to reexamine some methodologies of data science for their onto-epistemological grounds. This is the focus of \u201copen boundary conditions\u201d.\n</p><p>One of the initial questions that the oceanographers asked us in these workshops, was why the visualizations they have been doing aren\u2019t being received in a way which creates real change, why there is a deadening of effects when they produce their outputs even though they come in beautiful color stripes. They come in swirling movements across the globe, something that quite clearly shows the warming, why you can see sea level rise on their cross-section maps. These are obviously worrying, and if we take them seriously, they pose existential threat.\n</p><p>I think there are a lot of artists and designers who would happily produce \u201cbetter\u201d visualizations, but you have to wonder what are the parameters of \u201cbetter\u201d in this case? More affective? Seemingly more \u201creal\u201d? In fact, what we\u2019re interested in is the steps to get to the visualizations in the first place. So, the collections of data, the running of models, and then the output.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_grid_but_not_a_monument\">A grid but not a monument</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The first thing to note is the impossibility of conducting this kind of research alone: if it were important, it would be important to more people than me. So I\u2019m not very precious about the grid that I have proposed. It\u2019s not a monument. I think that perhaps there is importance in starting various forms of intensive learning, intensive study, which I see there is also a desire for.\n</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen the desire for exploring and explaining the technological back-end but I do see the desire for trying to get to grips with understanding oceanality and the ocean in an ecological sense. So I can see that there would be amazing possibilities for working with other people, in which you would hope that it wouldn\u2019t all be struggling with text. That it could find some visual form, that it could find some practical form, that it could find some performance form, working in combination with the histories of science as they are, but also recombining to make other forms of knowledge. I would never have done this without the oceanographers and the data scientists. There is no possibility that I could have understood harmonic constants without a little bit of input.\n</p><p>Yes, it comes form a concern that by working with a critique of technological processes of oceanography, towards data visualisation, I\u2019m only deconstructing the different inheritances of Modernity. For example, in looking at biopower through affect theory, looking at the way that color affects the regulation of the body and its response. Or looking at it through a criticism and awareness of colonial history, and how that\u2019s built the technologies in both extractivist and utilitarian ways. There\u2019s a legitimacy in doing that, but it doesn\u2019t create any kind of constructive conversation with anyone that I\u2019ve been working with- with oceanographers, with data scientists. It does create productive conversations with philosophers but that might not reach any conclusion.\n</p><p>My suspicion was that certain discourses that are happening in feminist science studies, in new materialisms and in feminist phenomenology could add to an understanding that in the end, a color stripe might not make that much difference, or create inaction. To do that, rather than to just open some books and read some pages, I thought that it would be more invested and involved, and careful and considerate and honest, and also confused, to take some objects and try to talk these through discourses and questions via those objects. So, I picked three.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Watery_Columns:_The_CTD_monitor\">Watery Columns: The CTD monitor</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The first example I picked was a CTD Monitor. CTD Monitor is a metal instrument which gets dropped down from an amazing buoy. There will be 10 or 12 CTDs which are arranged in a ring, and they get dropped, and sink to the bottom of the ocean. And then at some point, on a timer, they are released, and they will rise. And as they rise, their little metal mouths will open up and grab a gulp of sea water at a particular level. The mouths will close and they will proceed to the top and at some point they will be collected and this happens over a certain time period. Its testing for salinity, its testing for temperature, its testing for depth. Salinity is measured by conductivity and hydrostatic pressure I think.\n</p><p>This logic follows long history of the way that the seascape is carved up, which the CTD instruments will rise through. Originally, it would have been a hemp rope, weighted with lead, which would be dropped from the side of a ship, As it drops, it runs through the hands of the sailors. There are knots on the rope, and each knot represents a fathom, and the fathoms are called out, and someone marks them with a quill pen.\n</p><p>Through the architecture of Modernity, oceanography has the way of imagining the sea as a column. The sea is a very unstriated space that is imagined as an unchanging space. Even until today, this is how information is collected. Even the more unusual forms of data collection, such as the mini CTDs that are glued onto the heads of seals (a lot of the arctic data is from different seals who swim around). There is a GPS attached to it, and it still logged even though the seal is still swimming happily with that thing glued to its head. The sea is still divided up into a grid, at a certain depth, what is the salinity, temperature and conductivity, for example.\n</p><p>So, even when sea mammals are put to work doing scientific investigation, and this investigation is then recalibrated into what is fundamentally a giant technological system formed on axes, really. It really brings home the quite strict ontological ground for sea exploration, and the types of relationality that happen in a vast expanse of many different types of sea lives, and many different kinds of waters. Under sea vents, tectonic plates, underwater volcanoes, ecologies which are then being programmed into fundamentally the same model. The data are being used not to explore something different, but to expand Western knowledges along an axis.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spongy_Model_Edges:_FVCOM\">Spongy Model Edges: FVCOM</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-6\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Another way that the seascape is absurdly chopped or divided from its messiness and never-ending movement is the construction of maritime boundaries, which are basically virtual objects in the sea, which are carved up by what is a nation state, by what is landmass. They are geopolitical artifacts. For example, since the late 1700s, at one of the points in the Americas, at Saint Martha\u2019s Bay, the sea is recorded all the way down that coast, over the period of a year, and the mean sea-level is found. It\u2019s a mean sea-level, because tides go up and down, there are semi-diurnal tides, there are diurnal tides, there are mixed tides. There\u2019s waves! There are still sea movements that are foxing oceanographers. But in any event, the sea was averaged, there was highest point, the lowest point and the mean sea level was used to construct a zero, a datum. And from this point you start to measure mountains, upwards. How many kilometers above the sea is, how can you measure the sea? You measure it from the average of the sea. It\u2019s absurd, but it\u2019s also the globally agreed protocol.\n</p><p>So what happens when you introduce climate change into this phenomenon is that mountains start shrinking because sea levels are rising. It has sociological, geological, urban planning, planning applications, which are in end effects political. What is classified as a disappearing island, or a non-disappearing island becomes ratified.\n</p><p>FVCom is one of many multiple models that are used as a coordinate system. The example I gave earlier is just one example of data that is collected: salinity, temperature, depth, and obviously there are billions of data points that are also collected along rivers, along the coastline, and within the sea. One of the interesting things about how data is collected is that the nodes of data collection are very tightly packed around the coastlines, near rivers, and they are done on an isomorphic net, so it\u2019s a triangular grid system that can be scaled. It can be expanded or contracted depending how close you want to zoom into that particular part of ocean, or coastline. And as you move out to sea, the grid gets a lot bigger. So the point at which the data is collected is averaged so that the data can run. And way out it into the middle of the ocean, you might have a two kilometer or three mile point between each of those corners of the triangle of this net which, anywhere between this node, gets averaged. Whereas at the coastline, you\u2019ll have much tighter data, and the net will be in centimeters, or meters, not in miles.\n</p><p>So FVCom is one of the many models, called \u201cthe ocean model\u201d that we\u2019ve been looking into. All of these models begin in the late \u201960s, early \u201970s and onward, they\u2019ve been developed along the way in the intervening years and they take on more data points. What was initially not understood as being part of the ocean will then form one of the later models, for example, the biological model which is made of tiny life forms, phytoplankton and zooplankton \u2014 that came later. I already talked a little bit about how the models overlap and sync with each other.\n</p><p>Sponginess is a term used to describe the boundary conditions where one massive model meets another massive model. The data which was collected to put into the model, if I describe it historically, one of the ways in which the process of modeling happens, is \u2014 someone takes measurements over the course of the coastline over a year, and the data is sent in. And the sheets of data that are sent in would be really grubby \u2014 they would perhaps be water sodden; but they were basic tabulations about the tide heights, the moon, the distances between waves. Different data like that. Before the advent of computers as we know them now, this information would be sent, in this way to Bidston Observatory, so that\u2019s my access point into this history. And then that data would be fundamentally programmed so that the height of the tides or the wavelength, or the effect of the moon, would be run through different differential equations, and then it would be assigned a value. The value would be put into a tidal prediction machine. This machine was made of metal, with 42 brass discs. A band ran in-between these discs, each of the discs had a different name \u2014 for example, <i>m2</i> was the moon. And these discs would move up and down on arms. What was produced at the end of this computation- placed onto a roll of paper that was also onto a spinning drum by an arm, attached on one end with an ink pot, and the pen at the other which would draw out the harmonics \u2014 a wave. This wave was a prediction for next years tides.\n</p><p>The tidal prediction machines around the time of the Second World War could do one year\u2019s worth of predictions in one day. Different places around the world would send in their tidal calculations and they would receive back the predictions for the year, saying at what time what tide what height. The different harmonic constants, as they were called, that were run through the tidal prediction machines, they find themselves still in the predictions nowadays. They\u2019ve been massively updated, and there are obviously so many more data points- but you can still find them in how FVCom works.\n</p><p>One of the interesting things that happen in-between data collection, human error, different calculations and output, is that sometimes you get an output that does not resemble a harmonic \u2014 it doesn\u2019t resemble a wave form. It needs to be smoothed. At that time, in order to correct it, it was simply rubbed out and drawn on with a pencil. The computers in the 1930s (the women who operated the machines were called computers), had partners \u2014 the \u201csmoother\u201d, whose task it was to correct the prediction blip. I see that there is a connection between the isomorphic grid with the averages in the middle of the sea, and the job of the \u201csmoother\u201d. They are both attempts to speak to what is legitimate accuracy.\n</p><p>One of the strands of research that I\u2019ve been doing was helped a lot by a feminist science and technology scholar, Anna Carlsson-Hyslop, and she wrote a paper on Doodson, one of the previous directors of the observatory.<sup id=\"cite_ref-332\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-332\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> He was doing a lot of work on tidal prediction. She traces a line from his conscientious objection in the First World War to his subsequent work on aircraft ballistics. So while he doesn\u2019t want to go to war, he doesn\u2019t want to fight, he won\u2019t go, he is conscripted to do mathematical scientific research because he is good at math, to do calculations on the trajectory of bombs, instead of going to war. As a part of this work that he did, he developed a way of looking at the arc of a missile using differential equations.\n</p><p>Carlsson-Hyslop writes about the interaction between patronage and what is an accurate calculation. In order for these calculations to be done, somebody\u2019s got to pay for them. Doodson is receiving a wage, but he also knows that there are \u201cgood enough\u201d calculations for this set of conditions. When we think of the lineage of modeling, the impetus is to become more and more accurate. But its super helpful to keep in mind that there is a difference between <i>accuracy</i> and <i>legitimacy</i>. The necessity for accuracy supposedly makes it more legitimate, however, it doesn\u2019t correlate from a feminist science point of view.\n</p><p>I\u2019m just trying to figure out why I thought that the depths were denser. Obviously they are because there is more life there. The amassed points of interest are not the same as organic life. The surface of the water is more recordable, visible, datafiable. The depths are unknown. I think I was trying to make a link to what superficial means\u2026 like does it mean whether there\u2019s something productive in a literary sense. Superficial is able to be captured a lot easier.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Squints_&amp;_True_Colours:_CM_Ocean\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Squints_.26_True_Colours:_CM_Ocean\">Squints &amp; True Colours: CM Ocean</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-7\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The third object of study is called CM Ocean. It\u2019s a programming software that is running MATLAB, in order to output the data which has then been run in the model. It is a visualization that would run alongside, and produce varying different scales of data via color. So there\u2019s a lot of different programs which can turn ocean data into color, like heat stripes, water warming, sea warming, water level rise, salinity\u2026 lots of different kinds of data.\n</p><p>We started off this journey speaking about why visualization don\u2019t produce effect when they have to do with existential questions like Climate Change. So it makes sense to talk about CM Ocean.\n</p><p>The data that is transformed into these visualizations are numerical, it\u2019s quantity. And then they are translated into a scale that is absolutely not numerical, and are very subjective in terms of its reception. The aim of CM Ocean is to desubjectify and to make colour scientific. It is quite a task, which is surprising that a group would take it on. But CM Ocean is funded by BP, a multinational oil and gas company, and funded by George Bush. Its not that necessarily this has a one-on-one effect. But it\u2019s obvious, and worth noting that an oil company and the Texas Government would like to have a regulated way of understanding the contents of the ocean.\n</p><p>The second thing is that the subjectivity of color is aimed for regulation, which bypasses things like taste. It bypasses any kind of physiological reception. I was thinking that perhaps the expectation that color can be reproducible, that it can be accurate, that it can correctly represent numerical data, that it can\u2019t be divorced from numericizing color in the first place, the attributions of CMYK and RGB. If color is printed, it is different to if it\u2019s on a screen. There are so many unworkables to this method, if you think about it. But the belief is that its good color usage carries the responsibility of honesty. So, to use colors in an honest way is the responsibility of the scientist. But what is honesty in color representation of data points? Its previous iteration, called JETS, is supposedly not so accurate, not so precise because it has the movements through the color scale with arbitrary weights. So, this has you thinking that there\u2019s a density of whatever it is you\u2019re looking for in the ocean because this particular part of the color scale is more dense to you, to the reception of the eye. Dark purple rather than light yellow might misrepresent the density of the object in question, but you would never know that, because this perceived symbolism is skewed. The gradient of the color has to accelerate and decelerate but it might not do that at the scale of the numerical values have on the back-end. It might be that it looks like it\u2019s getting warmer quickly, but it depending on how this color scale is being applied, it could completely skew the numerical results that you\u2019ve run your model for.\n</p><p>It\u2019s also worth saying, that these models are hugely energy expensive, and take around forty days to run. The step from programming to output, massive amounts of electricity are used and the possibility for it to go wrong are quite large. If so, you would have to start again and try to recalculate. As I mentioned at the start of this conversation, if we look at these instances in the process of data collection to output, solely in a critical mode, then we fail in a remarkable way: the ocean, its inhabitants, what is life and what sustains us on this planet, is still and always our object of study. We need to propose other methods of working together, of offering feedback, which differently separate our object, or work with separability itself. The grid-not-monument we\u2019re working with here, is a try towards this.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Datum.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/a/a6/Datum.jpg/600px-Datum.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/a/a6/Datum.jpg/900px-Datum.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/a/a6/Datum.jpg/1200px-Datum.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Datum.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Datum point installed in the basement of Bidston Observatory, Kym Ward, 2021</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Frame:_Expanded_old_school\">Frame: Expanded old school</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-8\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>I want to try to think through these three cases in an expanded, old-school, social-constructivist feminist way where you would think about where that object is being produced, who produced it, how does it have an effect on and are there any, what are the linguistic and semiotic exchanges that take place because this technology has been built in this, and has been used by these people on these people. On these bodies, by bodies I mean the ocean, the body of water.\n</p><p>It is about naming where and when something has been produced, in order to properly understand the limitations of its production, about making clear the ramifications of who and not resorting to default \u201cI\u201d or displaced I of objectivity.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Frame:_Measurements_that_matter\">Frame: Measurements that matter</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-9\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The second frame is to use some of the work that has been done over the last 10 to 20 years on new materialism, to try to think about how for the fact that all of these objects measure in different ways, they produce matter in the way that they measure. So the CTD Monitor measures only X, it makes an apparatus which combines and makes the world in a certain way. Which is then, only just a tiny little data point which then is put into FV Com. It\u2019s difficult to talk about FV Com through new materialism, because it is such an object, but it can be done in a kind of reflective mode.\n</p><p>We tried quite hard in <i>Modeling Waves and Swerves</i>, to work this frame. It is possible, but it\u2019s much easier to look at one instrument than it is to look at a combination of instruments that form a massive instrument.\n</p><p>And also in the impossibility of retreat from a massive models that separate ocean life and atmosphere, for example. You need one of those models in order to have input on the data, but because they have already been divided in a certain way, you have to run with the implications of that. It is a lot easier when you go all the way out, but not when you are looking at FV Com and your looking at the back-end in order to understand as an oceanographer or a data scientist, thinking, \u201cOK, what would the agential cut be?\u201d.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Frame:_Gestationality\">Frame: Gestationality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-10\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>And the third strand, I call it \u201cthe feminist phenomenological\u201d, but it really comes from reading the work the of Astrida Neimanis, who wrote <i>Bodies of Water</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-333\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-333\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In the book, she speaks to ontologic and onto-logics, on the ontological of amniotics, and she is calling ontologic- not ontology which would deal with what \u201cis\u201d \u2014 but rather a who what when where how of commons of whatever it is we call more then human interlocutors. So, she speaks about amniotic in permeable open boundary membrane kind of ways. She is not only speaking about life that forms in the way of what she calls amniotes, life which forms in an amniotic sack, but she\u2019s also using it as a metaphor, as a fictional philosophical tool which is useful.\n</p><p>The reason that I had centered on this is why would feminist phenomenology have something to do with different modes of technical production of the ocean? She speaks to the water, different bodies of water that were along an evolutionary process, but also she speaks to them as a mode of reception and understanding and oneness with what is happening in the ocean. So it\u2019s a mode of understanding climate change, of potentially understanding sea warming. It has a lived bodily reality that we can connect to.\n</p><p>The second reason that I thought it would be worthwhile to walk down this path a little bit was because if your thinking about the onto-logics of amniotics, you\u2019re also thinking about gestationality, and gestationality also makes sense when you\u2019re talking about predictions, ocean predictions. Because what, in the end, what this movement between data collection and running the models and producing the visualizations defines what is seen to be the ocean, and what is not seen to be the ocean, the contents of the ocean, the conditions of the ocean, the life of the ocean, what is not life in the ocean. And the kind of predictions that are accredited and valued by science are highly technologized predictions.\n</p><p>The idea of what gestationality does is that it posits that life could come, the possibility for life is there, but we don\u2019t know what kind of life will come and what it will look like. We don\u2019t have a clue of it, its on the move and its emergent but there is no form to it yet. And this is something that I find, compared to prediction and its vast technologies that I tried to describe, I find gestationality useful and very exciting.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_17\">Notes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Open_Boundary_Conditions:_A_grid_for_intensive_study&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-11\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-330\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-330\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\u201cBidston Observatory Artistic Research Centre (BOARC),\u201d accessed October 20, 2021, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.bidstonobservatory.org\">http://www.bidstonobservatory.org</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-331\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-331\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Open call for \u201cModeling Swerves and Waves,\u201d accessed October 20, 2021, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.bidstonobservatory.org/?modelling_waves_swerves\">http://www.bidstonobservatory.org/?modelling_waves_swerves</a>.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-332\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-332\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Anna Carlsson-Hyslop, <i>An Anatomy of storm surge science at Liverpool Tidal Institute 1919-1959: Forecasting, practices of calculation and patronage,</i> thesis submitted to the University of Manchester for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Life Sciences, 2010.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-333\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-333\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Astrida Neimanis, <i>Bodies of Water: Posthuman Feminist Phenomenology</i> (Edingburgh: Edingburgh University Press, 2017).</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"contribution bugged-report\">\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Depths_and_Densities:_A_bugged_report\">Depths and Densities: A bugged report</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=Depths_and_Densities:_A_bugged_report&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Jara Rocha</b>\n</p><p><br />\nUnder the guise of a one-afternoon workshop at transmediale 2019, Possible Bodies proposed to collectively study open-source tools for geo-modelling while attending to the different regimes \u2013 of truth, of representation, of language or of political ideology \u2013 they operate within. It attempted to read those tools and a selection of texts in relation, with the plan of injecting some resistant vocabularies, misuses and/or f(r)ictions that could affect the extractivist bias embedded in the computation of earth\u2019s depths and densities.\n</p><p>The workshop <i>Depths and Densities</i> was populated by a mix of known companions and just-met participants (in total, a convergence of circa thirty voices), each bringing her own particular intensities regarding the tools, the theories, the vocabularies, and the urgencies placed upon the table. The discussions were recorded on the spot and transcribed later. This report cuts through a thick mass of written notes, transcriptions, and excerpted theoretical texts, sedimented along five vectorial provocations: <i>on the standardisation of time</i>, <i>on software vocabularies</i>, <i>on the activation of geontologies</i>, <i>on the computation of velocities</i>, and <i>on the techniques of 3D visualizations</i>. Each vectorial provocation was taken up by a sub-group of participants, who assumed the task of opening up a piece of Gplates, a free software tool and web portal for tectonic plate modeling. By holding close a technical feature, a forum, a tutorial, an interface etc. for a few hours, and tensioning these with some text matter from a reader pre-cooked by Helen V. Pritchard, Femke Snelting, and myself, Gplates worked as a catalyst for our conversations. Its community of developers would eventually become the deferred interlocutors of a report.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn313_334-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn313-334\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The following cut was made to share a sample of that afternoon\u2019s eclectic dialogues in what could be transferred as a polyphonic bugged report.

Together with a group of companions participating in <i>Depths and Densities</i>, a workshop in the context of transmediale festival 2019, we moved from individual somatic corporealities (or zoologically-recognized organisms) towards the so-called <i>body of the earth.</i><sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn327_348-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn327-348\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Our trans*feminist vector was sharpened by queer and antiracist sensibilities, and oriented towards (but not limited to) trans*generational, trans*media, trans*disciplinary, trans*geopolitical, trans*expertise, and trans*genealogical concerns.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn328_349-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn328-349\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Collectively we explored the volumetric renderings of the so-called earth and how they are made operative by geocomputation, where geocomputation refers to the computational processes that measure, quantify, historicize, visualize, predict, classify, model, and tell stories of spatial and temporal geologic processes.

Working through Gplates is a consideration of volumetric regimes as world building practices.

Bug reporting is a lively technocultural practice that has come to flourish within free software communities, where Linus\u2019 law \u201cwith many eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\u201d still rules.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn340_361-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn340-361\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> The practice is based on the idea that by distributing the testing and reporting of errors over as many eyes (hands, screens, and machines) as possible, complex software problems can be fragmented into ever smaller ones. By asking users to communicate their experiences of software breakdowns effectively, bug reporting forces \u201cthe making of problems\u201d through a process of questions and fragmentation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn341_362-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn341-362\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> It exposes so-called bugs to a step-by-step temporality, to make even the hardest problems small enough to be squeezable,<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn342_363-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn342-363\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> as they eventually are reduced to nothing more than <i>tiny</i> bugs.\n</p><p>In order to streamline the process of such squeezing, many software platforms have been developed to optimize the cycle of bug reporting and bug fixing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn343_364-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn343-364\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> \u201cIssue trackers\u201d help developers to separate bug reports from feature requests. A \u201cbug\u201d is a fault or an error that responds to what is already there; a \u201cfeature request\u201d, on the other hand, is a proposal that adds to the project-as-is; it extends an existing feature or ultimately necessitates the rethinking of a software\u2019s orientation. It is obvious that in such a technosolutionist framework, reports will attract attention first, while requests have a lower priority. Once identified as such, a bug can then be tagged as \u201ccritical\u201d (or not), assigned to a specific piece of code, a software release, a milestone, a timeline, or a developer who then will need to decide whether it is a syntax, run-time or semantic error. From then on, the bugs\u2019 evolution from \u201creported\u201d to \u201cresolved\u201d will be minutely tracked.\n</p><p>The issue with issue trackers and with bug reporting in general is that these are by definition coercive systems. Issues can only be reported in response to already existing structures and processes, when \u201csomething is not working as it was designed to be\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn344_365-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn344-365\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> But what if something (for example, in this particular case, a geocomputation toolkit) is not designed as it should be? Or even more importantly, what if geocomputation should not be designed, or it should be actively undesigned and not exist at all? Or what if there were no way to decide or define, in advance, how something should be without making an authoritative gesture of prejudgment and imposition?\n</p><p>Bug reporting tightly ties users\u2019 practices to the practice of development, making present the <i>relations</i> of software \u2014 it is a mode of practicing-with. Like Haraway\u2019s situated practice of writing, figured by Maria Puig de la Bellacasa as a \u201cthinking-with\u201d and \u201cdissenting-within\u201d, bug reporting makes apparent that software does not come without its world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn345_366-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn345-366\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Dissenting-within figures as both an embedded mode of practice, or speaking from within open-source software, problematizing an idea of a critical distance; but also has an \u201copenness to the effects we might produce with critiques to worlds we would rather not endorse\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn346_367-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn346-367\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Maybe it is time to file a bug report on bug reporting. Both writing and reading bugs implies a huge amount of empathy, but this is in fact a technically constrained sort of empathy: through steps, summaries, evidences, and indexing the reporter needs to manage her urgency and sync it with that of the wider apparatus of the software\u2019s techno-ecology and its concrete manipulator or interlocutor. What if we would use these processes for collectively imagining software otherwise, beyond the boundaries that are drawn by limiting the imagination of what counts as a bug, such as the productivist hierarchization between \u201cfeatures\u201d and \u201cbugs\u201d?<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn347_368-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn347-368\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Bug reports could allow space for other narratives and imaginations of what is the matter with software, <i>re-mediating</i> it with and through its troubles, turning it inside-out, affecting it and becoming affected by it in different ways.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn348_369-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn348-369\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> \u201cGPlates 2.1 was released today! Many bugs have been fixed, including the computation of crustal thinning factors.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn349_370-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn349-370\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In our attempt to imagine a bug report on Gplates, many questions started to emerge, not only in relation to how to report, but also because we were wondering <i>whom</i> to report to. In other words: a repoliticization of the practice of bug reporting implies thinking about the constellation of interlocutions that this culture of filing inserts its sensibilities in. If we consider software to be part of an industrial continuum, subjected to a set of values that link optimization, efficiency, and development to proficiency, affordability, and productive resilience, then where should we report the bug of such an amalgam of turbocapitalist forces? To whom should we submit reports on patriarcocolonialism? It also became clearer that making issues smaller, and shallow enough to be squeezed, was the opposite of the movement we needed to make; the trust in the essential modularity of issues was keeping problems in place.\n</p><p>GPlates for example, confirms users\u2019 understanding of the earth as a surveyable object that can be spun, rendered, grabbed, and animated; an object to be manipulated and <i>used</i>. There is, as Yusoff notes, no separation between technoscientific disciplines and the stories they produce, but rather an axis of power that organizes them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn350_371-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn350-371\">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Gplates is very much part of this axis, by coercing certain representational options of earth itself. But it also does so through computational choices on the level of programming and infrastructure, through interface decisions and through the way it implements the language of control on multiple levels. These choices are not surprising, they align with other geocomputation tools, other volumetric rendering tools, and with normative understandings of the agency and representations of the earth in general.\n</p><p>Could we imagine filing a bug report on Gplates\u2019 timeline implementation, insisting on the obscenely anthropocentric faultiness of the smooth slider that is moving across mega-annums of geological time? How would we isolate this issue, and say exactly what is wrong? And since a bug report requires reproducibility, how would we ask a developers\u2019 collective to reproduce the issue one more time in order to rigorously study options for nonreproducibility in the future, and what do we expect the collective to do about it? We need a cross-platform, intersoftware, intracommunity, transgenealogical way of reporting that, instead of making bugs smaller, scales them up in time and space and that can merge untested displacements and intersections into its versioning ladder.\n</p><p>The practices of bug reporting could be considered as ways to develop trans*feminist commitments to the notion of thinking-with.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn351_372-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn351-372\">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> This is a mode of engagement with technological objects that is potentially porous to nontechnical contributions; that is: to those by queers, women, people of color, non-adult and other less-entitled contributors. This also means that what seems (and is felt) to be the problem with technosciences has the potential to be arranged in other ways at the site of the bug report. Such porosity for <i>calibration-otherwise</i> and in differing domains, opens up through the intense squeezing, fragmentation, and proliferation of problems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn352_373-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn352-373\">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> This exterminating, almost necropolitical motion of squeezing operates on bugs that are small enough to be killed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn353_374-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn353-374\">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Squeezing to kill has as a rough consequence that those who are involved in the killing need to assume the responsibility for considering how and why to force through different conditions for the possible, but not others. Such considerations might generate semiotic and material circumstances for making interventions into the damages that are caused by the practices of geocomputation and software like GPlates.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn354_375-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn354-375\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> It might be a way to do what we call <i>queering the damage</i>, and to extend queer theories concerned with personal injury into geocomputational ensembles in order to consider the effects of damages shared by humans and nonhumans. By practicing <i>queering damage</i> in relation to geocomputation, we engage with the injuries caused by these volumetric practices. This is a kind of trans*feminist practice that does not seek to erase histories of injury and harm, but which recognizes that there is a generative force within injury.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn355_376-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn355-376\">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> A force that might take the form of partial reparations, response-ability, (techno)composting and reflourishing.\n</p><p>While we would like to consider bug reporting as a form of response-ability taking, there is also another option.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn356_377-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn356-377\">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> Instead of staying with the established manners dependent on the existing and hegemonically universalizing logic repertoire for technical processing, we might refuse to fix many tiny bugs under the guise of agile patching and instead consider opening a \u201cBUT\u201d gate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn357_378-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn357-378\">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> This is a political operation: instead of trying to \u201cfix\u201d the Gplates timeline, we could decide to creatively use it by for example setting the software\u2019s default for \u201cpresent\u201d to a noncorresponding year, or by mentally adding a 0 to each of the displayed numbers. Another way to stay with the trouble of software might be to use things as they are, and to invent different modes by the very practice of persistent use.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn358_379-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn358-379\">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Disobedient_action-research_as_a_form_of_bug_reporting_on_research_itself\">Disobedient action-research as a form of bug reporting on research itself</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_Have_Always_Been_Geohackers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<blockquote class=\"pull\">\n<p>They look over at the group of well-known companions and just-known participants, and ask: \u201cif multiple timescales are sedimented in contemporary software environments used by geophysics, can fossil fuel extractivist practices be understood as time-traveling practices?\u201d They observe that this will need to be a question for the bug report.

Let\u2019s now bug the way research engages itself with the world, and specifically how it affects and is affected by computational processes.\n</p><p>Orthodox modes of producing knowledge are ethically, ontologically, and epistemologically dependent on their path from and towards universalist enlightenment; the process is to answer questions, separate them from each other, and eventually fix the world, technically. This violent and homogenizing attitude stands in the way of a practice that, first of all, needs to attend to the re-articulation and relocation of what must be accounted for, perhaps just by proliferating issues, demands, requests, complaints, entanglements, and/or questions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn360_381-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn360-381\">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Image04.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/7/7d/Image04.png/600px-Image04.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"392\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/7/7d/Image04.png/900px-Image04.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/7/7d/Image04.png/1200px-Image04.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Image04.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Gplates main interface with data loaded</div></div></div>\n<p>Take vocabularies as a vector, for example: in order to report on the bug of using the term \u201cgrabbing\u201d in Gplates \u2014 of which a participant in the <i>Depths and Densities</i> workshop astutely observed that \u201cif all the semantic network of Gplates is based on handling and grabbing as key gestures in relation to the body of earth, a loss of agency and extractivist assumption slips in too smoothly, and too fast\u201d \u2014 we are in need of research methods that involve direct action and immediate affection into/by the objects of study.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn361_382-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn361-382\">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> She continued: \u201cAlso, the use of the verb \u2018to grab\u2019 brings with it the history and practice of \u2018land grabbing,\u2019 land abuse, and arbitrary actions of ownership and appropriation, which has been correlated both with dispossession by the taking of land, and environmental damage.\u201d In other words: if orthodox research methods deal with either hypothesis based on observations that are then articulated with the help of deduction or induction, we are in need of methods that affect and are affected by their very materialities, including their own semantics.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn362_383-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn362-383\">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>It is appealing to consider the practices of bug reporting as a way to inhabit research. As a research method, it can be understood as a repoliticization and cross-pollination of one of the key traditional pillars of scientific knowledge production: the publishing of findings. In this sense, bug reporting is, like scientific research, concerned with a double-sense of \u201cmaking public\u201d: first, it makes errors, malfunctions, lacks, or knots legible; second, it reproduces a culture of a public interest in actively taking-part in contemporary technosciences. The Underground Division considers bug reporting as a way to engage in disobedient action research. By practicing bug reporting, we might anchor our discussions in encounters with the world and the world that composes them \u2014 and this is closely related to the practice of <i>queering damage</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn363_384-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn363-384\">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> In this way, bug reporting becomes inseparable from the relations it composes with volumetrics, both with the technical and through its relations with queer and feminist theory. Disobedient action research \u201cinvokes and invites further remediations that can go from the academic paper to the bug report, from the narrative to the diagrammatic and from tool mis-use to interface redesign to the dance-floor. It provides us with inscriptions, descriptions, prescriptions and reinterpretations of a vocabulary that is developing all along.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn364_385-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn364-385\">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Action research as an established method is by definition hands-on, site-specific and directly interpelling systems, and in that sense, it is already close to the potential of bug reporting as a form of response-able research. In a way, action research is always already disobedient, because it refuses to stand back or to understand itself as separate from the world it is researching; with Karen Barad we could say that action research assumes it is \u201calways-already entangled\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn365_386-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn365-386\">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The \u201cdisobedient\u201d in disobedient action research means it refuses to follow the imagined looped cycle of the evolving timeline of theory and practice. It does not fit the neatly posed questions of a technical bug report neither. It instead works diffractively across the <i>deep implicancies</i> of collective research with software, cutting between various lines of inquiry.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn366_387-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn366-387\">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The specific disobedience that Possible Bodies brings to Gplates is the refusal to scope according to the probable axis of universalism, productivism, and determinism. It is a disobedience that instead moves across vectors, coordinates, and intersectional scales and \u2014 why not? \u2014 emerges from within those very vectors and their circumstances. It proposes a calibration-otherwise for volumetrics that can be understood as a form of disciplinary disobedience, a gesture that does not reject scale and the expertise of geocomputation but that problematizes its aftermath while experimenting with other applications and implications.\n</p><p>This disobedient bug report on Gplates therefore needed to ask about temporalities and their material and semiotic conditions, but at the same time concretely wonders how the software imagines the end of time(s), in a modelling sense.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn367_388-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn367-388\">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> Within such diffractive cycles, the disobedient bug report attunes to all types of bugginess within a process: \u201c[the underground] is no longer (or never was) the exclusive realm of technocrats or geophysics experts\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn368_389-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn368-389\">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tuning in to these various lines, disobedient action research has its own liveliness, searching out the bugginess in all tools, forcing a debugging of more than just software, and asking users and developers to consider a commitment to the deep implicancies of earth sciences, extractivism, software development, and coercive naming, to name only a few possible agential cuts. The point of disobedient action research is that the feminist commitment to stay with the trouble is made operational within the work itself.\n</p><p>These ongoing buggy moments of research and reporting then need to include the bugs within Eurocentric, identitarian white feminist theoretical frameworks and practices that we are uncomfortably infused by. The worlds which they are rendering visible worry us, and the ones excluded from this rendering urge us to try harder. As object and subject co/mingle in the bug report, worlds become recast, \u201cwhere poetic renderings start to (re)generate (just) social imaginations\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn369_390-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn369-390\">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup> In taking up the software tools of geophysics research and industry, we are reminded collectively that technical knowledge is not the only knowledge suitable for addressing the situations we find ourselves in.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn370_391-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn370-391\">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> As we anchor our disobedience in trans*feminist figurations, bugs obviously appear in how \u201cwe make it otherwise\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn371_392-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn371-392\">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> Rendering through figures, some of our anchors become lost and others become necessarily unstable, as they make certain worlds tangible, and render others absent.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Nonfixing_as_experimental_de/rebugging_@_Gplates\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nonfixing_as_experimental_de.2Frebugging_.40_Gplates\">Nonfixing as experimental de/rebugging @ Gplates</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/index.php?title=We_Have_Always_Been_Geohackers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<blockquote class=\"pull\">\n<p>What if the earth grabs back?<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn372_393-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn372-393\">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The attempt to write a bug report on Gplates forces us to reconsider the implications of a fix and its variations, such as the technofix and the reparation. As necessary as it seems to report the damaging concoction of representations, computations, vocabularies, and renderings, it seems important to not assume these issues to be addressed in order to (just) fix them in the sense of putting them back in circulation. Or to say it differently: to change it all so nothing really changes.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Image05.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/b/bf/Image05.png/600px-Image05.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"444\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/b/bf/Image05.png/900px-Image05.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/b/bf/Image05.png/1200px-Image05.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/index.php?title=File:Image05.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Gplates main interface (detail): grabbing the earth</div></div></div>\n<p>In the <i>turbocapitalist</i> <i>momentum</i>, are there other options besides abrupt deceleration and hyperlubricated acceleration? Are there ways of working without guarantees or attempting to resist ever-new reparative fantasies of technoscience? However, we are not calling for an anti-affirmative stance; but instead by making the leap in scale, together with queer and antiracist ontologies in our software critique we place an emphasis on damages across the industrial continuum of volumetrics. As Heather Love notes, queer practice \u201cexists in a state of tension with a related and contrary tendency \u2014 the need to resist damage and to affirm queer existence\u201d.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn373_394-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn373-394\">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup> In a mode of queering-damage-as-queer-existence, we extend the possibility of intervention from body politics to geopolitics.\n</p><p>To engage together in disobedient bug reporting might be a queer way to learn more sophisticated ways of identifying how regimes of truth, ideology, or representation affect our most immediate and mundane naturecultures. The hegemonic acceleration of contemporary technologies imposes a series of conditions that lead to the persistence of cultural forms of <i>totalitarian innovation</i> which must be resisted and contested. Yet those same conditions also constitute a complex of latencies and absences with which we have to inventively coexist, driven by the need for attentive, politicized presences. In a way, the persistent practice of finding \u201cbugs\u201d as another possible mode to conduct research tracks the potential to stay with the trouble of software in a responsible, creative way. The bug reporting on GPlates is an affirmative mode of software critique that refuses to organize along the vectors of reparation or resilience, but rather strives to grab back.\n</p><p>In other words, writing disobedient, collective, situated bug reports might be a method of pushing the limits of the probable and expanding the spectrum of the possible. Discussing technological sovereignty and infrastructural self-defense initiatives are good places to start, but those gestures are certainly not enough.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn374_395-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn374-395\">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> The first step is to methodologically identify and affirmatively publish the damages that coercive turbocapitalism inflicts through volumetrics and geocomputation. We need to join forces and write bug reports on these systems in order to technically equip ourselves with partial and localized repair possibilities, while resisting the production of ever-new and naive reparative fantasies.\n</p><p>As a future work, we started to think about what noncoercive computing would involve, as it becomes increasingly clear that the hubris of, let\u2019s say, the Gplates timeline is rooted in the colonial <i>computationalism</i> of such a project.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ftn375_396-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ftn375-396\">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup> It

She swallowed the paramagnetic contrast agent in one go, preparing her vessels to render themselves later. When the metallic taste faded, she could smell the ancient chestnut trees blossom nearby. Her crystal studded belt was stored with the pyrosome pendant in a strongbox outside the perimeter and the radio-pharmaceutical body-paint shimmered, still wet. Across from her, the others followed and struck an A-pose. Judging by the roar of the crowd that was barely audible from inside, tonight they would finally make a living.\n</p><p>Following their post-certification dreams, they ran their own techno-ecological show in excess of vision. The machine was rigged together from a salvaged General Electric Discovery MR750w and a Philips Ingenia 3.0T. For effect, several pieces from a scanner built in the seventies by the Electric and Musical Industries conglomerate had been added. This aclinical setup had cost virtually a million but when dismantled, the hardware fit on a standard trailer and the open sourced software did not take up more than two solid-state drives. The certificates doubled as a license for speculative imaging and now their only worry was how to pay for the astronomic electricity bills without starting a forest fire.\n</p><p>The lights dimmed and the noise grew louder until all solids vibrated: bones, glass, teeth, screws, violently rattling. They squeezed each other tightly as the machine picked up pace, centrifugal forces flattened their bodies against the curved superconductive screen behind. The ground dropped away and an electromagnetic coil lit up in the centre.\n</p><p>Now they all moved together, more-than-human components and machines, experiencing an odd sensation of weightlessness and heaviness at the same time. Limbs stuck to the wall, atoms bristled. Bodies first lost their orientation and then their boundaries, melting into the fast turning tube. Radiating beams fanned out from the middle, slicing through matter and radically transforming it with increasing intensity as the strength of circlusion decreased. The sound of the motors became deafening when the symmetric potential excited the rotating matter, pulling the cross-sectional spin-spin couples towards the central coil, forcing atomic spectra to emit their hyperfine structure. Once all fluids were accounted for, the volumes could be discretely reduced to graphs and the projections added up. Attenuating varying levels of opacity, a white helix formed in the middle which slowly gathered intensity and contrast. Faster and faster the machine spun until the cylindric screen lit up in the dark.\n</p><p>When the shadowgraphs appeared, the crowd howled as coyotes. Laminograms of differently densed matters rendered onto and through each other, projecting iteratively reconstructed insides onto the outer surface area. Collarbones entangled with vascular systems. Colons encircled spinal chords and a caudal fin, a pair of salivary glands vibrated with a purring larynx at a frequency of 25 to 150 Hertz. Brain activity sparked cerebral hemispheres, creating free-floating colonial tunicates of pulmonary arteries mingling with those of lower legs.\n</p><p>The math was breathtaking. Volumetric figures pulsated back and forth between two to three dimensions, transforming images into accidented surfaces and surfaces into ghostly images. There were mountain areas divided by sharp ridges, and watersheds preventing the draining of enclosed reservoirs. Methane leaked out of the old wells below and caused tiny explosions each time an image hit the surface. Calculating the distance between the edges of those catchment basins, the exponential boundaries between objects computed on the fly. There were dazzling colors as the sinographs peaked and the cubes marched. Whirling polygonal meshes exploded into a cloud of voxels before resurfacing as new nauseating contours, trapped in the vapours of the display. The continuing presence of the leftover, remnant of the former plutonium plant mightpotentially include anything that had escaped the nature refuge.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2._Night_studies\">2.

Some of us might highlight the urge to involve many more not-only-human companions, just like ourselves.\n</p><p>&gt; Whoops! Over there others claim that all of this is happening precisely thanks to how non-supervision has already functioned quite accurately for eons; everybody will perhaps nod and we will start computing together.\n</p><p>&gt; Key to our program is that the n-dimensionality of unsupervised machine learning radicalizes the project to the nth power.\n</p><p>&gt; Each learning machine decrypts a split for their teaching fee, a fraction of the full amount that we spend on whatever desire, a software fantasy or whatever we want. Or for cigarettes.\n</p><p>&gt; The one condition will be that we commit to talk about what to do with the tokens, and how to calculate the coins. In our meetings this is such a frequent consensual mode. At other times, glossy dissent might take place.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>This is how it goes:\n</p><p>At first we are buried and cemented in, and we cannot get through. But then a flower breaks through the asphalt and the old regime of waves is finally over. A radical symmetry of processing agencies materializes. There is no evaluation any more: this is the take of the spectrum. Despite the cost of electricity and the heat from the rapid fires, now we just can\u2019t get enough.\n</p><p>The four dimensions of our learning program are: depth (z), height (y), width (x) and time (t). Although some have argued for the dimension of affect (a), it is settled this is always already present here or, to put it differently, affective dimension is always-already intersectional. The program is open and rigorous:\n</p>\n<div class=\"list-with-custom-markers\">\n<ul><li><span class=\"custom-marker\">z)</span> For deep structures of either objectification or subjectification, or both, or third parts, in z they train \u201cprofound imaging\u201d. We learn to estimate our present density without classifying it.</li>\n<li><span class=\"custom-marker\">y)</span> The principle of the inverse problem: \u201cWhile the object or phenomenon of interest (the state) may not be directly measured, there exists some other variable that can be detected and measured (the observation) which may be related to the object of interest through a calculation.\u201d Exercising this problem can lead to an inversion into a stateless level. This is technically understood as \u201clow profiling\u201d.</li>\n<li><span class=\"custom-marker\">x)</span> Crystalogy it is. Gymnastic practice for the expansion of chosen prismatic geometric splendours.</li>\n<li><span class=\"custom-marker\">t)</span> Frequency. This module goes into the ontologies of ongoingness. In-determinate waving. An intensive training to not be always available.</li></ul>\n</div>\n<p>The four dimensions are rendered through continuous intra-actions with various devices and techniques. Machinic learners that are supposed to experiment with and be experimented on include (but are not limited to): computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultra-sound. While the frequency is mandatory, techniques, physicians, bodies are requested to certify each other intra-actively.\n</p><p>The schedule is almost full. Mid-red produces the worlding of vegetation, soil moisture content and, in some cases, forest phenomena. A heavy piezoelectric glow emits from the zone where sensitive detectors are placed. The tuners are humming, tuning with frequent errors. Neither the production nor the interpretation of ultrasound images are simple matter; mis-diagnosing mis-readings involves highly specialized forms of knowledge.\n</p><p>The party is going on. \u2018The spectrum is no longer (or never was) the exclusive realm of technocrats or medical experts\u2019, says a banner on the wall. That bunch of new wave spectrometers, speedy spectrophotometers, cats, or dark industrial spectral analyzers are shaking and hot. Turning around into something else. Our in-determinate ontologies are here to stay\u2026 or maybe not. With care, curiosity and passion, dissonant matters are all being made present. There is no discriminatory weight, but for sure there are mutual exclusions that need to be accounted for. Here subaltern scopes are critical and (still) celebrated. We are considered as rich, exuberant and glossy in our fierce but so-called-precariousness. From now on, language will need to inflate and mutate to fit the hyperspectral sensing; reading lists are not printed here. Until we reach the no-mattering-morning, we still have many nights to spend responsibly, living ourselves collectively in an exuberant way. A shy crew in an immanent shiny excess. Hell yeah.\n</p><p>When the light changes again, we finally finish. It works as a signal to shoot. We are exhausted but once propagated, our unlearned signals keep training on their own: unsupervising others, reversing geometries, undetermining yet-to-know subject-object mining. Our dreaming vigilance is the same at 9 am as at 2 am.\n</p><p>From now on, hyperspectral imaging takes advantage of the spatial relationships among the different spectra in this specific neighborhood of blurry limits. It is placed in practice to generate more elaborate misreadings of spectral-spatial accuracy models for the subsequent segmentation and classification of the image (otherwise understood as imagination). Sheer volume.\n</p><p>Check out that very corner, how it shows its complex composition. The low frequency but high-res flickering. Filled with noisy false colors.\n</p><p>Check out that roof over there, its densities deserve to be seen. Those sexy hyperspectrals are being rendered continuously. Let\u2019s follow them all the way into ultrasonic cosmo-dreaming.\n</p><p>Here-now. It is finally the moment to take the means for themselves. Everyone is here. The whole spectrum is present, and making itself present.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"3._Day_9\">3.

With their hands flat on the damp soil, bodies a faint outline along the edge of the drill site, they prepared for the ninth day computed tomography earth scan. At the night studies they assumed the were now activists. She was still clutching an instruction leaflet that read \u201cImage Wisely Programme \u2013 sign on in advance to an adventure that will leave none of the terms we normally use as they were\u201d. Under the dusk light the recently rigged solar panels shimmer against the device mirrors. Some of them were soldering connections over the soil with their portable irons, connecting the scanners across the earth\u2019s surface to the super computer user. In the reflection of her screen, she could see across the crowd a tangle of wires trailing out to fault lines, and as they draped these wires over their bodies in preparation, a long high pitched drone started to sound \u2013 as if a balloon was letting out air. In the distance, the dogs started barking a scene of wilding activities, they had learned about the possibility of this during training. The devices had begun. Infecting the entire structure as a whole. An electric field desiring a field born of charged yearnings. Cell death.\n</p><p>Earth bodies no longer accepting of the role assigned to them were beginning to emerge from the orbiting electrons, a few days and night had past but they seem to have lost count and felt somewhere in between, apart from when the speaker sounded to the Unix time-stamp announcing the day, hour, minute and second of the slice. Dark regions began hitting the photographic film fastened on the back of an old protest banner. The banners were propped up behind them, dark regions beyond expertise. These dark regions were now infected by a different purpose. She shivered, her fur bristled and a layer of cold fell over the crowd. Someone smoking a cigarette draped a leather jacket over her shoulders. It smelled like cattle, tannin and fashion magazine cologne. As they turned, and rotated, an earth-body, they listened into photons, bursting with innumerable imaginings of what might yet(have) be(en). She listened carefully, concentrating for rumors she had not heard before. Densities she had not experienced. Stories set into motion the moment they spill. Addressing intensities.\n</p><p>It was the ninth day of the scan and their bodies began to understand what their ears could not. The difference between a dream and a nightmare \u2013 kinetic energy, a net positive electric charge, material wanderings/wonderings began to burst through the earth\u2019s surface, sending rays through them. They had discussed this possibility at the training camp. Three dimensional patterns began to divide the absorption of the earth beneath them. A diagnostic system. Water, strata, bone, skin, began to absorb the rays at differing rates. X-rays were traveling outward in some general direction hitting atoms \u2013 a quivering electric field. Together they were rendering fractures, internal structures of earth bodies. Here comes the math. Layering slices on top of each other building a three dimensional image. Tissues, microbes, minerals, systems superimposed on top of one another \u2013 examining the tomographic details, structures and the harms of fossil fuel capitalism of the past. Beyond any hope of a recuperation but instead searching for the refusions of the mineralized past.\n</p><p>In this picture the voice over the tannoy exclaimed \u201csacramental plurality\u201d. The super computer user was shifting, forming an image of the cross section of the body that could be read on the salvaged screen. Data layering on top of one another to form the entire superuser organism. As the machine body rotated, electrons continued to be produced. Electrons colliding with atoms, transmitting through the entire body these electrons sources. A pleasuring intensity of measurements at all possible partial angles. They were awash with a thickness, a plurality of experiences occurring simultaneously \u2013 like a person walking by. Intensities began to break up, the different transition rates, and a voice started to sound numbers. As the final time-stamp was called, the gnu begun to gather on the edges of the drill site, occasionally drinking from the runoff pools, with their blunt muzzles and waiting for the signal.\n</p><p>It felt like days before the algorithmic processes wound down, for the machine to slow down and the gravitational pull to take hold again. Slowly intensities were reduced and attenuated. Voxels of bone and mineral started quivering as they were numbered. MR750w. Gradually restricting the handful of variables, the ground came back up and one by one the bodies slid down from the walls that had heated up under the strain of intensive calculations. The high pitched drone stopped sounding and the usher began to take down the barriers. They blinked at each other across the dim radius, faintly glowing, still resonating.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"4._Certification\">4.

Together we are turning the <i>Volumetric Regimes</i> research into a book. It will be published by Open Humanities Press (OHP) as part of the DATA browser series for which you designed a layout template a few years ago.<sup id=\"cite_ref-403\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-403\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>.\n</p><p>For Possible Bodies it was important to take design decisions and tools into account as part of the content of the book, and also to extend the conditions of openness provided by OHP, by not only making it possible for readers to download the PDF, but to also enable them to learn about and reuse the editing, production and design process itself.<sup id=\"cite_ref-404\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-404\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The series editors insisted that we could take the design of the book into our own hands, as long as we would \u201cfollow the template\u201d. They did not specify what this would mean exactly, but made clear that it was important for them that we honored your original design. I realize now that I waited as long as I could, but today I could not postpone this part of the process any longer. The way the DATA browser books were produced so far is quite different from the way I work, so we needed to find a way to produce this layout otherwise, from scratch. This letter is my attempt to speak to you about that process.\n</p><p>My design and research practice is shaped by (and shapes)<sup id=\"cite_ref-405\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-405\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> free software and collective work. This practically translates into layouts being generated by scripts, books being rendered out of webpages and editorial workflows being transformed into collaborative environments. Working in this way allows me to stay with the complexities of technology, learn about the implications of layout software and approach the profession of design as an embedded networked practice.\n</p><p>So today the strange game of sticking to our commitment to make this book look <i>just</i> like the other books in the series starts. But where to start? The InDesign files that were used for the other books in this series cannot be opened with any of my free software tools. Besides not being able to open these files, also the iterative workflow we have set up to collaborate as a designer with the editors on the design and the editing, does not match. \n</p><p>We\u2019re working with a self-hosted MediaWiki platform, a <i>wiki</i> in short, that we as editors and designer can use to edit and structure the materials. From this wiki, we download and reformat everything into a single webpage, which becomes the main document that will be styled and turned into a layout using CSS3 paged media standards. We use the Javascript library Paged.js to paginate this layout in the browser and export it as the final PDF. Paged.js is a relatively new project developed by a group of people that closely work with the W3C consortium, which is the international organization for web standards, such as HTML and CSS, and they decide which features will be supported by modern browsers and which not. I\u2019ll end there, but the range of people, tools and environments that co-shape this design practice is much larger. The networks of networks of people working with similar attitudes and sensibilities are actually indispensable for making this design practice possible and viable. And who knows what will happen afterwards, once the material<sup id=\"cite_ref-406\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-406\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and documented code<sup id=\"cite_ref-407\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-407\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> is published online and available for re-use thanks to the CC4r (Collective Conditions For Reuse) license.<sup id=\"cite_ref-408\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-408\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> So besides the impossibility of trying to link up with a different and by now for me quite alien set of tools, I am wondering how to reconnect your pre-formatted aesthetics to the way this book is being made? \n</p><p>On the cover of <i>Volumetric Regimes</i>, we decided to use <i>Multi Remix</i> made by Winnie Soon and Geoff Cox in which the face is not constructed out of typographic characters,<sup id=\"cite_ref-409\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-409\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> but instead made out of variable geometric shapes using the Javascript library p5.js. <i>Multi Remix</i> is a code exercise in the textbook <i>Aesthetic Programming</i>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-410\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-410\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>, where it is contextualized with a critical note on the face as a static technological symbolic object and \u201cimperial machine\u201d: \u201cThe face is part of a surface that promotes sameness and ultimately rejects variations.\u201d<sup id=\"cite_ref-411\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-411\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>We found a font that aligned with the one in your template and replicated the layout\u2019s dynamics and overall structuration. But many questions still haunted us: How could this book actually ever pass as a lookalike of the so-called Stuart Bailey template, as an agile gesture of implementation for yet another bundle of content? What agency do design-interventions have once a template is set? How to design this book as part of a trans*feminist responsibility with the world-making praxis that design implies, shoulder to shoulder with the many companions that worked on editing (and hence caring for) this volume? \n</p><p>Of course these questions open up new and sharper ones, like, for example, the consideration of situated design, the implications of declutching content from form, the assumptions of optimisation, agility and efficacy as editorial values... and so forth.\n</p><p>I decided to write you a letter as a way to reflect on this strangeness, and hopefully along the way I manage to describe how this book is radically different from the other books in the series. This is not a complaint, on the contrary it is a way of making space to imagine different kinds of embedded design practices and to better understand how different ways of working are shaped by (and shape) different realities.

This becomes especially urgent in relation to technologies, infrastructures and techniques of 3D tracking, modelling and scanning. How does cyborg-ness participate in the presentation and representation of so-called bodies? Intersecting issues of race, gender, class, species, age and ability resurface through these performative as well as representational practices.\n</p><p><b>Helen V.

It is dug by Helen V. Pritchard, Jara Rocha and Femke Snelting with the help of many other others. Which are the presences, latencies, absences and potentials that need to be accounted for, in relation to that deep and thick complexity? The Underground Division bugs contemporary regimes of volumetrics that are applied to extractivist, computationalist and geologic damages. The research will eventually culminate in the Trans*Feminist Rendering Program, a hands-on situation for device making, tool problematizing and \"holing in gaug\". <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://ddivision.xyz\">http://ddivision.xyz</a>\n</p><p><b>Kym Ward</b> lives and works in Bidston, Liverpool, UK. She is one of the founding hosts of the Bidston Observatory Artistic Research Centre, a not-for-profit study centre, focused on providing artists, writers, academics, performers, etc., with a cheap, temporary place to dictate their own working methods. She moves between more solitary performance research practice and organising and enabling alternative or non-hierarchical educations. Her interests lie in productive critique: of softwares\u2019 production of social relation, of technologies of organisation and, when possible, the cheeky reappropriation of institutional

cultures of quantified presence</b>\n</p><p>Edited by Possible Bodies\n</p><p>3D computation has historically co-evolved with Modern technosciences, and aligned with the regimes of optimization, normalization and hegemonic world order. The legacies and projections of industrial development leave traces of that imaginary and tell the stories of a lively tension between \u201cthe probable\u201d and \u201cthe possible\u201d. Defined as the techniques for measuring volumes, volumetrics all too easily (re)produce and accentuate the probable, and this process is intensified within the technocratic realm of contemporary hyper-computation.\n</p><p>This book brings together diverse materials from an ongoing trans*feminist conversation between artists, software developers and theorists working with techniques and technologies for detecting, tracking, capturing, printing, modeling and rendering volumes.\n</p><p>CONTRIBUTORS:\n</p><p>Manetta Berends, Sophie Boiron, Maria Dada, Pierre Huyghebaert, Phil Langley, Nicolas Malev\u00e9, Romi Ron Morrison, Simone C Niquille, Possible Bodies, Helen V.
