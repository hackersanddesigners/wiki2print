social problems and the concern for material existence on earth is more pressing than ever. When looking at the field of art and design, this means that research into our relation to the world around us and the actual making of things has acquired a new urgency.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> <i>Making Matters</i> asks what role visual artists and designers can play under these conditions. The book gathers a number of relevant making practices and investigates the urgency from which they arise.\n</p><p>One of the main departure points of <i>Making Matters</i> is the realization that collective action is necessary and inevitable, in society at large as well as in the field of the arts. Collective art and design practices therefore are the main focus of this book. They point to a transformation of working methods that not only shapes and changes practices but also affects artists and designers in their position and identity: from individuality and autonomy to experimental collectivity and collaboration, locally as well as globally.\n</p><p>A new perspective on \u2018making\u2019 becomes apparent here. When practices shift towards collaborative making processes instead of individual products, what does \u2018making\u2019 and the production of concrete, material \u2018things\u2019 mean? Artists collaborate with non-artists and in doing so may take on other identities, such as researcher, community activist, computer hacker, or business\u21b5 consultant. The research done by these artists departs from the most diverse areas, from logistics\u21b5 and biotechnology to geology or dance. <br />\nAs a result, the distinction between art, design, research, and activism is dissolving. It follows that these practices may hardly be recognizable as art or design practices any longer, nor are their outcomes necessarily identifiable as artistic outcomes, let alone as specific art works. Some of these practices no longer conform to a conventional Western idea of art and art making. This book aims to identify some of their key concepts and to make their vocabularies accessible to a larger public.\n</p><p>The practices brought together in this book address specific ecological and social problems, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly. All of them embrace the complexity of the various crises that we find ourselves in and try to develop ways of dealing with them. They experiment with and embody examples of new ways of living together and of <br />\na sustainable existence on Earth with all living beings.\n</p><p>Material artistic practices\u21b5, i.e., ways of concrete making and doing, often go hand-in-hand with <br />a theoretical inquiry. The textual and visual contributions in this book embody this intertwinement of conceptual and material thinking. The authors share an interest in artistic research\u21b5, a relatively newly institutionalized research field that connects doing and thinking, making and theorizing, in a reciprocal exchange that does not prioritize one over the other. In artistic research\u21b5, practical action (making) and theoretical reflection (thinking) go together, action and thought are inextricably linked.\n</p><p>Art contests the age-old dichotomy of theory and practice. Since Modernism, it has involved a constant questioning of the role of art and artist. The practices presented in this book put these questions on the table once more. They exemplify the attempt to bridge the distance between theory and practice, or even (in some cases) to obliterate the distinction between art production, critical reflection, and everyday life. <br />\nThe roles of artist, curator, institution\u21b5 (museum, Kunsthalle, artist-run spaces, biennial, documenta) and audience may become fused in the production of art.\n</p><p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\n</p><p>This development raises fundamental questions <br />\nof authorship and of the status quo of the art object and process: where is it situated and how can it be perceived or experienced? The materialization of art, its aesthetic dimension, its \u2018aesthetic\u2014felt, spatio-temporal\u2014dimension\u2019,<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> is acquiring new meaning and importance. In the light of the pressing challenges that we are facing on a global scale, and in the light of the critical and discursive potential of contemporary art practice, \u2018making\u2019 matters more than ever before.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"how.2C_on_what_ground.2C_have_the_contributionsto_this_book_been_selected.3F\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"how,_on_what_ground,_have_the_contributionsto_this_book_been_selected?\">how, on what ground, have the contributions<br />to this book been selected?</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-3\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Artists collectives are at the centre of attention in contemporary art discourse.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The 15th edition of the world\u2019s leading contemporary art exhibition documenta (2022) will bring the contemporary art phenomenon of multidisciplinary collectives to a wider audience. Not only are its curators, the Indonesian ruangrupa collective, such a collective themselves; most artists invited to documenta 15 are multidisciplinary collectives, too.\n</p><p>This book aims to contribute to the growing body <br />of literature on the phenomenon of the art collective in its present-day, multidisciplinary, and hybrid form.<br /> It aims to provide insight into the subject matter of these collective multidisciplinary practices. Most contributors are practitioners whose work falls in the cracks between the disciplines of art, design, critical theory, research, performance, community organization, social activism, and critical engagement with technology. Even when their work is grounded\u21b5 in one of those disciplines, it usually encompasses at least two others. In the end, these practices and the texts in this book complicate the following questions: What is research when it is done by artists? What is \u2018making\u2019 when it is informed by critical theory and turned into activism? What is \u2018technology\u2019 when it is articulated by performance artists and in community projects? What happens when their implicit concepts, definitions, and vocabularies, which differ from mainstream understandings of those same concepts, are explicated in a specific vocabulary?\n</p><p>The project began with a four-year research project by our material practices\u21b5 workgroup into the possibility of a crossover between art, design, and technology as an alternative to the capitalist-driven concept of the \u2018creative industries\u2019 consortium. <br />\nIt ended with the observation that alternative crossovers exist in the often overlooked and often overlapping fields of artistic research\u21b5, artists\u2019 and designers\u2019 experiments with commons, Open Source culture, post-humanism and biopolitics, alternative economies, and community organization. Artists do not simply depict or reflect upon these varying perspectives from a critical distance, but radically translate them into their everyday ways of living and working, in other words, into material practices\u21b5. This book aims to explicate tacit knowledge from artists\u2019 material practices\u21b5 and from real-life experiments conducted in a world in crisis while gaining insight into present-day paradigm shifts <br />\nin the arts.\n</p><p>The different disciplinary groundings of our contributors correspond to the respective disciplinary groundings and research specializations within the material practices\u21b5 workgroup: Leiden University, Willem de Kooning Academy, Het Nieuwe Instituut, Waag, West Den Haag. Based on the expertise and the discussions in the workgroup, contributors were invited who could help to both focus and complicate the question of how artists practices and real-life experiments amount to knowledge for ways of living and survival in the planetary crisis.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"reading_guide\">reading guide</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-4\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Introduction&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The vocabulary of concepts relating to collective material art practices\u21b5 presented here is not an encyclopaedia nor even an inventory and it is by no means complete.

It is laying out a new, shared skin. This is the first act in zo\u00f6nomy\u21b5, a practice of fostering ecological integrity for groups consisting of radically different, human, and other-than-human bodies that find themselves joined together in this new type of community.\n</p><p>A zo\u00f6p is an effort to claim a shared reality among highly divergent bodies. To call them a collective body is partly a trick, a move to direct attention. It is partly hopeful aspiration and partly something that was found to be part of the idea of \u2018body\u2019 all along.\n</p><p>Zo\u00f6ps consist of wide varieties of bodies: other-than-human bodies such as microbes and earthworms, trees, plants and algae, water bodies and more; human artefacts such as buildings, machines, and such; organizational bodies such as teams, boards, associations; legal bodies such as owners, third parties with contracts, municipalities, jurisdictions. Clearly, all these bodies are by themselves collective bodies, too, even when they nominally join the zo\u00f6p as single entities.\n</p><p>To start a zo\u00f6p is thus to articulate a new collective body by saying: you now belong together in a new way. This is the trick. This collection of collective bodies now has to find out how to live together. That is the aspiration.\n</p><p>Any non-abstract, materially existing body is not a singular thing anyway. A singular point only exists as a mathematical construct and abstraction. Any actual dot in any world is never a point but a body and, by that virtue, also some kind of multiplicity \u2013 it has an outside and therefore an inside.\n</p><p>All collective bodies are networks and part of networks, connected to myriads of other bodies. Many bodies are members of multiple collectives at the same time. Therefore, the boundary of any collective body is not fixed. A collective body\u2019s shared skin needs to be enacted, performed,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> for a specific purpose and context, and once it has been recognized (or resampled symbolically) by other collective bodies, it will be more sharply defined. It will shimmer into place. New bodies join all the time, and some bodies leave. Performing such a shared skin is the ongoing effort of every zo\u00f6p.\n</p><p>To do the work of the skin is to metabolize particularities of the world and also to put up some resistance\u2014on behalf of the body\u2014to being metabolized. A degree of metabolization is necessary for a body to exist, to be present, but to be metabolized entirely is to cease to exist.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The constituents of a collective body remain intact bodies. They still have their own skins\u2014a bit thinner at some places, maybe.\n</p><p>The Umwelt or life-world<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> of any body is that which can be metabolized: chemically, aesthetically, conceptually, politically, economically.

The observatory was to be strategically situated on the highest point of the Wirral peninsula, overlooking the river Mersey, the river Dee, and the Irish sea. Completed in 1866, it was made out of sandstone extracted from the bedrock below, creating a cavity which now forms the observatories\u2019 extensive basements.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Around the building, a deep moat was dug to minimize interference from neighbouring traffic. The plinth in the picture above is a \u2018bedrock connection point\u2019, located in the observatory sub-vault. Sheltered from temperature shifts and movements from elsewhere, the plinth provided a stable platform\u21b5 for a century of exacting earth observation.\nCornwall, last fall. Suddenly they feel the ground tremble, and hear windows rattle. Afterwards, Dr. Ryan Law, managing director of Geothermal Engineering explains to the local press:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>As part of the United Downs Deep Geothermal Power testing, we did cause some micro-seismicity. Although this was within our regulatory limits, we are stopping operations until we understand the cause. The tremors are low-scale and should not be anything to be afraid of.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Geothermal energy is produced by harnessing heat from the earth\u2019s core. To produce power from this heat, extremely deep wells need to be drilled and water is pumped through them at high pressure. Since the Bronze age, Cornwall has been mined for tin, copper, arsenic, and lithium. Tremors in the porous underground\u21b5 are set off as a result of the additional disturbance caused by geothermal boring. In the non-committal words of the general manager, they sense all the troubles that wreck the earth: \u2018we caused micro-seismicity\u2019 \u2026 \u2018within our regulatory limits\u2019 ... \u2018until we understand the cause\u2019 \u2026 \u2018not anything to be afraid of\u2019.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"embeddedness:_laying_in_a_bed_of_surrounding_matter\">embeddedness: laying in a bed of surrounding matter</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matter_Lexicon/Embeddedness&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-3\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matter_Lexicon/Embeddedness&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>South or north of here, already more than ten years ago. It takes him many long days to level the driveway of his holiday home. Using a <i>barre \u00e0 mine</i>, a forged iron bar originally used by miners to pound the ground and break the surface, his movements reverberate through the valley. Eventually, he hits an immovable piece of rock and the pounding stops. He points, almost proudly, and says: \u2018look, the earth!\u2019\n</p><p>Early on, the observatory installed a seismometer on the sub-vault plinth. Kept in the dark, it continuously auto-registered slight movements on light sensitive paper that corresponded with earthquakes experienced on the other side of the planet. A Milne-Shaw Vertical Tiltmeter was acquired in 1910, a precision instrument based on the same principle as the seismograph, where one part remains stationary and fixed, while another part moves together with the earth\u2019s surface. The vertical tiltmeter derives its precision from using a rigid arm that points upwards, with a pendulum hanging down from it. The swinging of the pendulum, with its fulcrum fixed to the bedrock connection point, makes micro-seismicity observable by magnifying the actual motion of the earth. It was with this instrument that the phenomena of \u2018tidal load\u2019 could be observed, the oscillating north-south tilt of the Wirral peninsula due to the strain of the water weighing down the bedrock (and subsequently, the plinth itself) at high tide.\n</p><p>A physiotherapist once told me about her interest in how bodies feel their way around with the help of instruments. She explained her fascination through the example of cooking a soup or a sauce. If you stir the bottom with a wooden spoon, she said, you will feel precisely at which moment it starts to catch. You do not need to put your hand into the hot liquid to touch the bottom of the pan.\n</p><p>At the observatory, the so-called \u2018ocean loading effect\u2019 continued to be registered with increased precision until the early seventies, when the expanding data about earth tides from around the world started to show unexplained discrepancies in neighbouring sites; the magnitude of the north-south tilt varied by twenty percent when measured in one end of its sub-vault, or the other. In an article called \u2018Tidal Tilt Anomalies\u2019, two scientists working at Bidston claimed that these inconsistencies could be explained by unknowable couplings between the landmass movement and the strain on the site itself. \u2018A mine or a tunnel, in which tilt measurements are usually taken, represents a discontinuity in the Earth\u2019s crust.\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> By comparing different types of instruments, they found that tiltmeters were extremely accurate but that they were measuring tidal tilt in combination with hyper local movements due to situated geological conditions. Tidal tilt observations where eventually abandoned due to non-compliant embedded data.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"embeddedness:_trembling_with_the_earth\">embeddedness: trembling with the earth</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matter_Lexicon/Embeddedness&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-4\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matter_Lexicon/Embeddedness&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As with many material evidences of techno-scientific progress, the appointing of stability, the fixing of a point zero wherever convenient, seems to require an entitled mode of being in the world.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Each point is merely a conceptual marker, which can be assigned and reassigned in the equation hierarchy as the \u2018coordinating zero point\u2019 and every line can be formed to be the \u2018coordinating axis\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Power arranges itself around such arbitrary vantage points, through which the movement of goods and people elsewhere can be controlled.

You may be surprised to read a text written in the first person in a lexicon of collective material practices\u21b5, but I would like to ask you to read my I, myself, as a collective effort in and by itself. Without you I wouldn\u2019t be here after all. And whatever I have done, as a \u2018junior embedded artistic researcher\u2019<i>,</i> I didn\u2019t come up with that myself. I held the job of junior embedded artistic researcher at the research project that this lexicon is part of. I decided that my research, asking how the artist performs within the institution\u21b5, had to start with this peculiar job description.\n</p><p>In this case, the word \u2018embeddedness\u21b5\u2019 has an institutional provenance. The governmental organs who funded this research project are tailored to academic research in which this term indicates a specific institutional relationship. You can imagine a research project in the field of biology, in which case a junior researcher would do their research at one of the commercial partners of the project (the laboratory of a company, for example). They would, as a result, be \u2018embedded\u2019 in that company.\n</p><p>When you replace the biologist with an artist, you can see how this description inadvertently sketches out an unusual practice, reminiscent of the placement of artists in non-art organizations by the Artist Placement Group in the 1970s and 1980s. On top of that, I was placed or embedded in an exhibition space, which already works with artists, but in different capacities. They exhibit artists, and the staff is also populated by many young artists. I would be embedded as an artist in an institution\u21b5, but not working at the institution\u21b5 as an artist; it would be different. How, I didn\u2019t know yet.\n</p><p>Online searches for embeddedness\u21b5 quickly lead to a specific context: it denotes the position of journalists who travel with the military to report from the front lines. I can\u2019t think of a more paranoid image.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In addition to these two perspectives, I also like to think of the more basic reading of embeddedness\u21b5: two objects of different materials, one big and one small, where the smaller object is firmly lodged inside the other. I imagine a stone in a riverbed, creating an impression with its shape, while it gets smoothed over time.\n</p><p>My adoption of the condition of embeddedness\u21b5 as a research subject, was precisely the start of my performance of embeddedness\u21b5. Because of certain misconceptions that originated in modernity, artists are not encouraged to embed or lodge themselves firmly in their own conditions. This relates to causality: as an autonomous artist, the primary cause for action should be your own initiative (inspiration, or creation). Artists, like artworks, like art in general, strive to be free and independent, separate. To explain the misconception I think of a Spinoza Symposium at the contemporary art space West Den Haag, where I first heard Spinoza\u2019s parable of the stone that was thrown.<sup id=\"cite_ref-17\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> If the stone, Spinoza wrote, would get a consciousness mid-air, it would mistake itself into thinking that it made itself fly. If the artist is a stone, then \u2018the institution\u21b5\u2019 (see: institution\u21b5 as practice) controls most of the conditions that make it fly and keep it flying.\n</p><p>When considering the embedded state of a stone, we might observe its conditional dependence, but we can only do so by grace of its difference. There is by definition a difference between the stone and the riverbed, between object A and object B. If they were the same, there would be no embeddedness\u21b5 to observe. To get back to this particular project: if I, as an artist, use the infrastructure of the institution\u21b5 in the same way as other artists, I would not be embedded anymore. Or, if you insist that all artists are in embedded relation to the institution\u21b5, I can point out that I wasn\u2019t only embedded in the institution\u21b5, but in the institutional position of embeddedness\u21b5 as well.\n</p><p>Something that helped me think through the tension between embeddedness\u21b5 and difference is the figure of the parasite. As A.M. Gullestad wrote: \u2018Parasites are both a part and not a part of the host\u2019s body, neither self nor non-self.\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> They exist in relation, yet do not assimilate. Through time, the strangeness of the parasite might be appropriated by the host. This phenomenon is deeply ingrained in our bodies: the mitochondria that energize our cells are said to have started out as parasites, they even have their own DNA.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Gullestad links the notion of parasite to the notion of \u2018minor literature\u2019 which Deleuze coined in a book on Kafka, a writer who lived and worked in Prague as part of a German-speaking minority: \u2018To Deleuze, minor literature is therefore not external, but internal to a major language, yet at the same time \u201cforeign\u201d to it.\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> This sounds a lot like embeddedness\u21b5. Thinking through the parasitic, embeddedness\u21b5 evokes paranoia: who is using whom? Am I using the energy that the mitochondria provide, or is it the mitochondria \u2018who walk through the local park in the morning \u2026 thinking my thoughts?\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This parasite/host relationship is not clear-cut. Just like we have parasites fuelling our cells, we have bacteria in our intestines, digesting our food; strangers truly are inside of us. I can fantasize about being external to the infrastructure of art, for example, but we, as artists, makers, readers of this lexicon, are the bodies through which the institution\u21b5 of art propagates. I host the institution\u21b5, as much as I am a parasite.\n</p><p>Before despairing\u2014because how does one research something one is so much entangled with?\u2014I tell myself that there might be no true distance, no separability to hold on to, but there is no true proximity either (see: criticality). I am a different material, I practice differently. Following the model of embeddedness\u21b5 does not have to lead me to assimilation. The main questions I ask myself are: Which shape does the institution\u21b5 that is <i>embedded</i> in me imprint on my practice, and which shape do I imprint on the institution\u21b5 as an embedded artistic researcher? How am I hosted and how do I host?\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-16\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-16\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, \u2018Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You\u2019re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You\u2019, in <i>Touching Feeling</i> (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2003), pp. 123-152.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-17\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-17\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Moira Gatens, \u2018Living on the Gallows?\u2019, Spinoza &amp; the Arts Symposium (West Den Haag), 4 October 2019.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-18\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-18\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Anders M.

One of his prescient claims was that what he called \u2018technical images\u2019 would take cultural precedence over the foregoing dominance of text. He defined technical, or synthetic images, as \u2018projections from the level of code\u2019, code inscribed in the apparatuses of modernity, be these technical or institutional. Technical images are, according to Flusser, \u2018images of texts\u2019 and thus synthesize human knowledge in forms that speed up critical responsiveness such that it can keep up with a very unstable condition.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Flusser-l.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/7/76/Flusser-l.jpg/300px-Flusser-l.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"231\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/7/76/Flusser-l.jpg/450px-Flusser-l.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/7/76/Flusser-l.jpg/600px-Flusser-l.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Flusser-l.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text.</div></div></div>\n<p>But what would those technical images look like? How might they come to be employed for the critical purpose proposed by Flusser? Luckily, he was able to demonstrate what he had in mind, in a series of collaborations with artists. In experimental videos that he made with the sociological artist Fred Forest, Flusser explored the power of the human gesture as one of the new possibilities for critical human thinking, unlocked through video technology. In the video, Flusser can be seen gesturing avidly as he speaks about gesture. Forest, too, is instructed to gesture with his camera movements, and to criticize Flusser through these gestures. Likewise, Flusser instructs the future viewers of the video to use their own gestures in order to criticize both him and Forest. The viewers\u2019 gestural feedback should then, Flusser and Forest intended, be captured on video, too, and edited into the next iteration of the tape.\n</p><p>This playful exercise is not only a new form of philosophy for the age of technical images. It also points to a more general critique of cultural production. The semantic content of an utterance fades behind the gesture with which the utterance is made. Additionally, this thinking through gestures is patently embodied and situated: It breaks with the enlightenment and modern-age pretension of an abstract, disembodied, pure rationality, embraces contingency, subjective experience, and becomes open for more people. Flusser\u2019s commitment was in tune with his times and various critical revisions of enlightenment rationality in the twentieth century. It was an answer to the challenge of how to reject disembodied rationalism without also giving up the possibility of critical thinking. This issue had also been explored by his contemporaries Marshall McLuhan\u2014with his penchant for slang and vernacular\u2014and Donna Haraway with her leaky neologisms and troubled ironies.\n</p><p>In the gesture, the intent of the utterance and the effects it produces, the experience it generates, is more important than any particular semantic content. In other words, non-verbal communication is more important than verbal communication, connotation more important than denotation. Consider the Facebook algorithm, which allows advertisers to manipulate the emotions of target demographics in real time, as revealed in the 2017 Cambridge Analytica scandal. Advertisers no longer send merely one message lauding their product. Instead, they send a series of messages, which in their aggregation nudge their human targets towards the desired purchases or other behaviour. In the electronic age, the gesture of publishing is thus fragmented into myriad probing moments. As McLuhan quipped, the medium is the massage.\n</p><p>A show in the cybernetic community\u21b5 Alphabetum, \u2018Free Emojis\u2019, explored emojis as a contemporary manifestation of gestural communication. What Flusser had provoked his readers with in the 1980s, has become today\u2019s reality. Digital natives are indeed finding that technical images are far more apt for the analysis, commentary, and communication of our experience in the electronic age. Conversely, by observing emoji use we discover that text has not disappeared. In fact, we are writing and reading more than ever before while text has become more explicitly gestural.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"hosting\">hosting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Hosting&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Hosting&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Eleni Kamma</span>\n</p><p>hosting: a material practice\u21b5 that is linked to events in which humans are invited to participate. hosting as a material practice\u21b5 relates to conditions of production in the field of socially engaged art, aimed at creating a community. hosting operates in hybrid contexts between the physical and the online. Its relevance for social, technological, and cultural interactions is the re-imagination of how \u2018I\u2019 may relate to \u2018we\u2019 and vice versa.\n</p><p>During the Making Matters conference (November 2020), three live Etherpad sessions were hosted by researchers Anja Groten, Eleni Kamma and Pia Louwerens. These were interactive meetings in an online collaborative notepad, where participants discussed symposium topics that came up during the conference. Each of the three sessions experimented with online collaborative engagement. Communicating through the pad takes place purely on a level of ideas and writing and utilizes one\u2019s ability to relate mentally through typing. All participants control and co-edit the text that is produced on the pad during the meeting. Despite its democratic intentions, the pad privileges those who prefer writing over speaking as a means of expression; it does not allow for equal access or experience for analphabets, people who have dyslexia and other learning disorders; and it excludes active participation for those not explicitly invited to the conversation. The one(s) who set up a conversation on the pad are also those who establish the group and do the inviting by sending the link. It depends on the pad\u2019s host(s) whether they will publicly or privately share the link online.\n</p><p>On March 3, 2021, I explored \u2018hosting\u2019 further through an online participatory event hosted by Jubilee, a platform\u21b5 for artistic research\u21b5 and production, of which I am a member. The aim of this experimental public event, which consisted of four unique presentations, was to offer perspectives on nourishing through online communication tools. Upon registration, future participants were sent four simple \u2018recipes\u2019 (each conceived by one of the event\u2019s hosts: Samah Hijawi, Philippine Hoegen, Eleni Kamma and Gosie Vervloessem), which they were invited to prepare beforehand.

Choreology is the aesthetics and study of human movement through movement notation. Particularly Rudolf Laban\u2019s initial notions of \u2018effort\u2019 and \u2018place\u2019, as situated in the seat of sensation of the performer, and actioned in relation to the body\u2019s physical journal\u21b5, give relevant entry points.\n</p><p>From his Rosicrucian roots, dancer and choreographer Rudolf Laban created a movement praxis he called choreutics, which reflected what he articulated as Space Harmony. It is based on patterns of rhythm and balance that can be perceived everywhere in nature, including in human anatomy. Laban saw spatial patterns in the pathways of human movement and recognized in these the shapes of the Platonic Solids. Expressive human movement closely aligned with the inclinations in the structure of these regular polyhedral forms.\n</p><p>Laban took the spatial patterns that follow the Platonic Solids as forms to be actualized through human movement. He came to articulate specific Movement Scales: a series of patterned movement sequences that performers can repeat; moving through these pathways in a predefined way. These Scales linked the natural spatial gestures\u21b5 of human bodies that move along all directions and inclinations to the directions of the vertices of a platonic shape. Following these movement Scales opens up the body in space and also enlarges spatial awareness. It balances the body spatially and aesthetically. This is why this spatial practice is called Space Harmony. \n</p><p>At the same time, Rudolf Laban further investigated the nature of harmonious and efficient effort and coined the term eukinetics to address this study. eukinetics is a combination of two Greek root words\u2014\u2018eu\u2019 meaning beautiful or harmonious and \u2018kinetikos\u2019 meaning movement. During the final two decades of his career in England, Laban\u2019s interest and analysis shifted from creative and artistic movement to a broader concern with human movement in general.\n</p><p>In parallel to this he dropped the exotic word eukinetics and adopted the more common English term, \u2018effort.\u2019 The term addresses an abstracted concept, that when studied always needs to be understood in context. How effort is situated can be seen by answering a number of key questions. Whose efforts are we referring to? What are the reasons for this effort? Where and when does the effort take place? How does the effort take place? Why is this effort performed at all? Working with these and other questions in his investigation of effort led Laban to identify two main domains of action, both of which give rise to practices of ever refining mastering of spatial experience and spatial skill. One group is comprised of goal-oriented actions such as sports\u21b5 and political and commercial endeavours. The attention of the bodies engaged in these actions is focused on the exterior and their spatial skills are applied to navigating and strategizing the use of space outside the body. The other group of actions is directed towards expressive goals such as artistic gestures\u21b5, religious and cultural performance. The attentions of bodies engaged in these kinds of actions is focused internally, and their skills are applied in charting an outward expression of their inscapes. This second group of actions also leads to and mobilizes self-knowledge.\n</p><p>Performing and experiencing the return beat\u21b5 provides the metaphysical context for both forms of effort, where both the navigated inscapes of the percipient practitioner, and their outward expressions of goal-oriented action are spatial, and the extra internal dimensions of self-awareness can lead to self-knowledge. As such, the return beat\u21b5 facilitates a wave-field for human activity.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"chapter chapter-collective\" id=\"chapter-collective\">\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"collective\">collective</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=3\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: collective\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: collective\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"artificial_friendship\">artificial friendship</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=ArtificialFriendship&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=ArtificialFriendship&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Lilia Mestre</span>\n</p><p>Dear you,\n</p><p><br />\nHow are you? Here is an excerpt of a letter I wrote during the first confinement, April 2020 when I was invited by Roselle Pineda / PCI to give a talk about curatorial approaches in time of halting and transformation. I would like to share this with you because I\u2019m interested in what you think about it.\n</p><p>My practice as a curator consists of creating a correspondence between several artistic researchers through a combination of presentations and writing practice. We address each other not directly as in a normal feedback activity, but with the delay of the letter, the delay of reflecting on what a critical response could be and how we want to formulate it, with which language.\n</p><p>The delay of the letter produces criticality\u21b5 as a modality of care. I\u2019m holding on to you, while responding to your work. I carry you with me. I think through you. You change me. I\u2019m totally in love with the idea that a critical world is a world of change. An inclusive environment of transformation.\n</p><p>I call for artificial friendship.\n</p><p>This concept is a paradox, a provocation, and an attempt to give attention to how to engage with concerns, people and materialities that are not ours and might not seem interesting at first view because they don\u2019t address us directly.\n</p><p>I call for artificial friendship, and here you are. I open up the potential of friendship with you to be able to make myself available to write to you. I\u2019ve been thinking about the concept of artificial friendship after creating scores\u21b5 (see: scoring\u21b5) as an infrastructure for encounter in which I could observe and experiment with a relational shift in the approach to others. A mode of relation that is based on taking seriously, and accepting as a valuable companion in life, that what doesn\u2019t correspond directly to my understanding of the world. To take into consideration not the symbiotic but intra-dependent relationships, the close and the far at the same time. The known and the unknown and the in-between.\n</p><p>I call for artificial friendship as a form of dedication to the unknown. A form of care for the ones we don\u2019t know. Dear stranger, how are you? How do you feel? What do you do?\n</p><p>I\u2019ve been asking myself; how can friendship and artificiality be partners towards an infrastructure of care for the other. Paradoxical at first instance, both these concepts, if allied, can create the conditions for a sociability of commitment, dedication, attention, patience, and inclusion. I have been working with scores\u21b5, in their artificiality, to set a series of scheduled moments in time and space with clear constraints, where one can perform what friendship does, and even become art[ificial] friends, without there having to be a friendship in the first place.\n</p><p>This is an invitation to spend time together. To meet in a place that offers availability and the moment of being present to each other. The sort of agreement one can commit to when visiting a friend. I would like to propose that we think thoroughly about this when we think about curatorial and performing approaches. About spaces and conditions that introduce forms of attendance that are not consumeristic but involve the vulnerability of coming together, as a form of care for the other. A form of care for a complex societal ecosystem that can embrace change.\n</p><p>If you\u2019d like to get back to me you can reach me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"mailto:lilia@apass.be\"><span class=\"underline\">lilia@apass.be</span></a>\n</p><p>Looking forwards to reading from you.\n</p><p><br />\nWarmly,\n</p><p>Lilia\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"babanton_art\">babanton art</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Babanton&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Babanton&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"the_good_neighbours_agree_to_always_agree\">the good neighbours agree to always agree</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Babanton&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-2\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Babanton&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Bunga Siagian &amp; Ismal Muntaha</span>\n</p><p>The word <i>saling bantu</i> (mutual assistance) is meant to separate it from the terminology \u2018collaboration\u2019, \u2018participation\u2019, \u2018involvement\u2019, \u2018cooperation\u2019, words that are widely used to explain community-based art practices. Not only do those words arise from a different context in the art scene, but in the context of language they are also not sufficient to explain the situation of Jatiwangi, as the rural centre of Indonesian clay production. <i>Saling bantu</i> is the Indonesian translation for the Sundanese <i>babanton</i>, which unfortunately does not capture its precise meaning, nor does the English translation \u2018helping each other\u2019 (translator\u2019s note: \u2018mutual assistance\u2019 or \u2018mutual aid\u2019 may be more appropriate terms, although they still may not capture the full extent of the meaning). <i>babanton</i> is distinct from the words collaboration, joint work, <i>gotong royong</i> (the well-known ethos in Indonesia regarding collective work), and other similar words that presuppose as well as rely on goodwill, willingness, agreement, and the need to do something together. However, it has its limitations: it applies to collective needs (not personal needs, therefore it is often institutionalized by the state). It is spontaneous and current (of urgent needs, such as clearing clogged sewers, and so on), and cannot be romanticized as an ever-present value in a community.\n</p><p><i>babanton</i> is a game. It is crucial to understand the gameplay. First, from its terminology: in Sundanese, \u2018help\u2019 (<i>Indonesian: bantu</i>) is translated as \u2018banton\u2019, but the word <i>babanton</i> contains a repetition of \u2018banton\u2019. It means the help is reciprocated, like in a game. <i>babanton</i> is a societal value in Jatiwangi. As a game, it starts from individual needs. In neighbourhood social practices, as a good neighbour, it is a social obligation to help a fellow neighbour who is having <i>hajat</i> (event, ceremony, errands). Therefore, we need to sacrifice our \u2018time\u2019, even if it\u2019s work time. It subsequently establishes a social \u2018currency\u2019 that uplifts our dignity as people living in a community. A help from our neighbour, as a currency, may be exchanged in times of need.\n</p><p>JaF artistic practices engage with the spirit of the community\u2019s <i>babanton</i>. In the early days of JaF, many initiations or art projects were nothing but but <i>hajatan</i> presented by JaF that were held by Arief Yudi\u2019s family\u2014a distinguished family in the village (his brother Ginggi was the Village Head at the time). The neighbours acted as good neighbours to do <i>babanton</i> in the artistic activities, whether they understood them or not, needed them or not. What they knew was that the neighbour was having a <i>hajat</i> and was in need of help. Afterwards, automatically, JaF would also be involved in this mutual assistance game by being a good neighbour, from providing a sound system and a stage on a neighbours\u2019 <i>hajat</i>, designing logos for neighbours\u2019 products, making or editing videos, documenting pre-wedding photos, to merely fixing printers. One time, Ginggi blurted, \u2018Any talk of art in society without ever helping a neighbour\u2019s <i>hajat</i> or attending a neighbour\u2019s funeral is utter baloney<i>.</i>\u2019\n</p><p>Let\u2019s imagine that JaF\u2019s neighbours are also other community members, local governments (at least Arief Yudi\u2019s schoolmates or Ginggi), roof tile factory entrepreneurs, police, and other institutions\u21b5. Then, automatically, they will be involved in the <i>babanton</i> arts that manifest in the ever-expanding collective artistic practices, in which <i>tanah</i>\u21b5 is exalted within. This interplay between art and <i>babanton</i> enriches them both; art expands the <i>babanton</i> practice into not just an individual matter\u2014celebrating a marriage or making a house is being turned into larger collective works. On the other hand, <i>babanton</i> restores art to an important position in creating the imagination and action of a living space that is good for collective life.\n</p><p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Babanton-slide1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Babanton-slide1.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/db/Babanton-slide1.jpg/300px-Babanton-slide1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/db/Babanton-slide1.jpg/450px-Babanton-slide1.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/db/Babanton-slide1.jpg/600px-Babanton-slide1.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Babanton-slide1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Babanton-slide1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/db/Babanton-slide1.jpg/300px-Babanton-slide1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/db/Babanton-slide1.jpg/450px-Babanton-slide1.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/db/Babanton-slide1.jpg/600px-Babanton-slide1.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Babanton-slide1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Why art, design, and culture are still important is because they deal with methodologies\u2014comings together and ways of seeing and playing that precede the politics that most everyday folk don\u2019t even realize addresses (or neglects, or unfairly treats) them. So education, and welfare, and government funding all need to go through a self-reflexive hall of mirrors, so to speak.\n</p><p><b>F:</b> I couldn\u2019t agree more. At the same time, I\u2019m afraid of the empty gestures\u21b5 and buzzwords that will get ticked off (like, for example, \u2018care\u2019 as a now-ubiquitous noun in art project funding application prose) if this becomes more mainstream. In Europe, I also witness the constant failure of artists to truly commit to collective projects and not just use them as platforms\u21b5 for displaying/performing their individual portfolios.\n</p><p><b>E:</b> Yes, it is not surprising at all that we\u2019ve watched the hype on care build up over the last year, but as someone primarily confined to margins, the mainstreaming of discourses is also something to learn and navigate as part of our practices. The tricky thing about care, and so many other widely debated issues is that they really need to be enacted rather than simply theorized or talked about. But the need to repeat, repeat, and repeat again to people who are less affected by what is lacking in the socioeconomic system (power is a crux issue at every scale) is a necessary part of expanding possibility. It entails \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 and popularizing and this gives those of us who do want to speak and practice from a position without power a tremendous pressure to re-circuit, re-articulate, and re-work the existing imaginaries.\n</p><p>What you mentioned about the failure to really collectivize in Europe is also a problem in Hong Kong and China. When HomeShop, the artist-run project space I was involved with from 2008\u20132013, was invited to participate in the \u2018<i>Unlived by What is Seen\u2019</i> exhibition in 2014, the curators told us they wanted to include us as a collective practice because they felt that all the other collectives they observed in China at the time were merely solidarity-for-opportunity kinds of conglomerations, often splitting up when the group becomes famous enough that the individuals of a group can then make their way with solo careers.\n</p><p>So it\u2019s no wonder that so many of us have that starry-eyed fascination with the hype of many Indonesian collectives, <i>haha</i>, but as discussed with my friend Riar Rizaldi in a talk a couple of weeks ago, there are many problems there as well that tend not to get discussed publicly, and the exportation of <i>nongkrong</i> can in some ways be just as much of a selling strategy like anything else.\n</p><p>That said, having much more time to read and dilly-dally around in a confined space these days, I finally got to read your paper on 1970s Mail Art more carefully, and the key value I can take from the various examples you present is to see similar struggles and resonances resulting in similar impulses and tactics, such that your idea of the \u2018eternal network\u2019 represents a notion of affinity.\n</p><p><b>F:</b> Yes, and I am also wondering whether these struggles, resonances, and mistakes need to be constantly re-enacted and repeated by each new generation in order to be fully (<i>i.e,</i> not just in an abstract or disembodied manner) understood.\n</p><p><b>E:</b> There are changes along the way, from generation-to-generation mutation. But I fear that despite such continuities, there is also a repetitive relegation to the realm of marginal play. Whatever foresight those projects from the sixties forward had for internet behaviours today\u2014and as you say our pinpointing of AI/algorithms as the evils of the system is misplaced\u2014how could intimate and networked actions parasitizing off of larger infrastructures really affect anything?\n</p><p><b>F:</b> Maybe that\u2019s the problem\u2014that, by focusing on (larger societal) effects, we\u2019re unintentionally superimposing growth or impact expectations on these projects while their main value might have been their subjective-collective experience, and functioning as an experiment?\n</p><p><b>E:</b> Thank you for the reminder. I have to tell myself again and again in so many arenas to focus upon \u2018subjective-collective experience, and functioning as an experiment\u2019, rather than the unintentional but hard-to-escape notions of growth, development, and impact, as you say\u2026 The question of change is perhaps na\u00efve and misplaced. Regardless, it is difficult not to acknowledge outcomes as part of the process of communication that happens among any form of collective organizing. How that communication occurs is central to the difference between centralized or decentralized processes, and I think Display Distribute\u2019s inquiry into grey economies actually implicates us within certain murky areas between centralization and decentralization. These have been some of the greatest challenges to the project, but they are reasons to continue. You are right that \u2018radical inclusivity\u2019 does not necessarily garner any momentum, but neither do elitism and the reverse snobbery of oligarchic movements, which is a critique of both ends of the political spectrum.\n</p><p>If as you say the main value is located in the experiment of a subjective-collective experience, then your previous question might be answered by saying that the constant re-enactments and repetitions by new generations <i>are</i> necessary. Embodiment and affect cannot be historically reviewed except as practiced singularities, right?\n</p><p><b>F:</b> Yes, but you could also criticize that as a petty-bourgeois hobbyist self-limitation that gives up on the larger picture\u2026\n</p><p><b>E:</b> Completely on the mark as well! There is a close friend with whom I have had many emotional disputes along these lines, and perhaps this pinpointed critique precisely circles us back in some way\u2014whether as a picture or a way of manoeuvring\u2014to the necessities of an eternal network.\n</p><p><br />\n<br />\n<b>2021-02-19</b>\n</p><p><br />\nDear \u6162\u905e\u54e1\u6613\u62ce\u4f55\u5b50 (&amp; \u598d\u5ef7),\n</p><p>HQL-364 is currently quarantined in a hotel in Taichung.

At the same time the concept of community has fundamentally changed through digital communication technology. It is a common assumption that non-digital local communities are distinct from digital global communities, but in fact the two are rather mutually and dynamically related in feedback loops of technical effects and social responses. This cybridity gives new urgency to the concept of community. Now, more than ever, it produces cultural and social tendencies and needs that defy expectations, place, and time.\n</p><p>Our actions have effects and these effects act back upon us in a learning process. While this is an uncontroversial statement, the age of hyper automation gives us the impression that this experience is massively compounded, as in a meta-butterfly effect, a feedforward hall of mirrors, or hell of mirrors. Our actions seem to have at once too little and too much consequence. How to get the right sense of scale in today\u2019s intensively networked environment? Community no longer seems to have continuity, but appears to be an ad hoc grouping which could just as well be otherwise. One can be a part of several \u2018communities\u2019 at once, and then just as suddenly, of several others. As a community, we act as intersections of multi-dimensional Venn diagrams where our world of associations reconfigures around us in real time.\n</p><p>Of course community still has a centre of gravity, its provisional situatedness. In tension with the networked context, every member of a community has its own situatedness, if only in that of their physical body or device. What happens if a social network is radically distributed, and no longer runs on a central server, as in the case of software projects like Patchwork/SecureScuttlebutt? Then the network coheres around the chief maintainers of the project.\n</p><p>A community is always intractably material. What we would like to examine are the relationships and tensions between the participants and the material apparatus that entertains them. The physical space of the contemporary art institute West Den Haag includes an \u2018Alphabetum\u2019 which could be called a proto-institutionality dedicated to the forms of letters (grammatography\u21b5). The community around the Alphabetum coalesces around its physical space, just as a community of an online social network coalesces in its respective physical space, i.e., its servers.\n</p><p>The Alphabetum functions as a laboratory for cybernetic community knowledge creation, the generation of unlikely and unexpected forms of expression and exchange. Also, as it is cybernetic, it is committed to storage, archiving as a recursive practice in a kind of communal learning. The exhibitions in the Alphabetum are probes sent out into the community for responses, which are processed and built into subsequent exhibitions. Through this recursive feedback process, the Alphabetum \u2018learns\u2019 about the environment that is interested in the programme. At the same time, it is instrumented by the public to respond to their interests. This community exercise is concretized in the exhibits on display in the Alphabetum, which are subsequently curated and recontextualized by the community.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"platform\">platform</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon/Platform&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon/Platform&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Anja Groten</span>\n</p><p>In recent years the Hackers &amp; Designers collective<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> has been frequently approached by organizations and initiatives from the fields of art, design, technology, and academia with the question: \u2018Do you want to design our platform?\u2019 An intricate question as the term platform refers to a multitude of phenomena and objects. The platform\u2019s ambiguity seems particularly amplified when articulated as part of a design brief, suggesting that the platform is to be an expansion of the realm of designed <i>things.</i>\n</p><p>An organization as platform supports individuals or groups in addressing an audience. In a computational context, the term platform refers to a technical infrastructure, for instance an environment in which software applications are designed, deployed, or used, such as computer hardware, operating systems, gaming devices, mobile devices.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>With the H&amp;D collective we have designed, built, and maintained technical infrastructures, such as software, webware, and services that enable online collaboration, production, organization, and publishing of digital content. Such diy\u21b5 platforms are tool convergences that\u2014in their particular composition\u2014cater to the particular needs of the collective. They are content management systems,<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> chat applications,<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> collaborative writing tools,<sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> online spreadsheets<sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and file sharing systems.<sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> These self-made, appropriated or hacked tools and systems are implicated in the ways the members of the collective work together. H&amp;D\u2019s technical infrastructure continuously evolves, and at times fails, or acts in an unexpected way. H&amp;D shapes and reshapes its modes of organizing around the possibilities and limitations of such self-made platforms\u2014along with learning to cope with system incompatibilities, broken links, expired protocols, and unreliable backups. Therefore, the notion of platform is at the core of its existence.\n</p><p>The platform-design request implies that a platform can be regarded as separate from its context, and that there is a causal relationship between platform and design. However, because of how the H&amp;D collective has developed relationships with technical infrastructures it would be difficult to disconnect the technical aspects from the organizational and social aspects of platforms. The question then arises whether platforms\u2014in the way we relate to them at H&amp;D, as an inherent part of the collective\u2019s fabric, including its characteristic of constant emergence, spontaneity, and unreliability\u2014can be designed at all?\n</p><p>In my view, the question: \u2018Do you want to design our platform?\u2019 wrongly implies a certain fixedness, a beginning and an end of a digital platform and the possibility to foresee a platform\u2019s trajectory. The \u2018commissioners\u2019 who formulated the request position themselves as end users of the platform, and suggest some kind of ownership of it. It would be \u2018their\u2019 platform that \u2018we\u2019 are designing. However, a platform, as I see it, in its manifold of meanings is interwoven in collective practice and cannot be owned.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"thinking_with_platforms\">thinking with platforms</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon/Platform&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-2\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon/Platform&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Besides its technical connotations, the term platform is also often used figuratively, for instance referring to organizations such as H&amp;D. As such, it tends to assign an assumed value to the platform-organization as supportive and enabling, and risks a flattening of the technical and organizational particularities and implications of a collective. The question is how to think <i>with</i> the various meanings of \u2018platform\u2019? How do platform\u2019s different (technical, organizational, architectural, political) connotations intersect\u2014act together and apart?\n</p><p>In 2020, H&amp;D developed a physical structure,<sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> the \u2018H&amp;D platform\u2019, together with architectural designer Thomas Rustemeyer.

The platform would be activated at different moments, for instance as a workshop space, a stage for performances and presentations, and as a reading room.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Platform-full-bw.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/0/0a/Platform-full-bw.jpg/300px-Platform-full-bw.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/0/0a/Platform-full-bw.jpg/450px-Platform-full-bw.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/0/0a/Platform-full-bw.jpg/600px-Platform-full-bw.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Platform-full-bw.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>H&amp;D platform installation, Tetem Enschede, May 2020</div></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Drawings-ThomasRustemeyer_underground.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e3/Drawings-ThomasRustemeyer_underground.jpg/300px-Drawings-ThomasRustemeyer_underground.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e3/Drawings-ThomasRustemeyer_underground.jpg/450px-Drawings-ThomasRustemeyer_underground.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e3/Drawings-ThomasRustemeyer_underground.jpg/600px-Drawings-ThomasRustemeyer_underground.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Drawings-ThomasRustemeyer_underground.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Sketch by Thomas Rustemeyer, 2020</div></div></div><br />\n<p><br />\nHowever, due to the global Covid-19 pandemic the platform as we had initially envisioned it remained more or less unvisited and untouched. Yet, through the sudden need for our planned activities to continue online, we developed other, digital, means of pursuing our activities. For instance, we created a project website that showcases the work of the contributing artists<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> and draws together their research and process documentation. We furthermore developed the \u2018H&amp;D livestream platform\u2019 as we witnessed an increasing fatigue of commercial platforms. The fatigue is caused by large tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft or Zoom, who profit from their user\u2019s reliance upon them in times of crisis by selling their data.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Screenshot-livestream.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e4/Screenshot-livestream.jpg/300px-Screenshot-livestream.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"192\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e4/Screenshot-livestream.jpg/450px-Screenshot-livestream.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e4/Screenshot-livestream.jpg/600px-Screenshot-livestream.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Screenshot-livestream.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>H&amp;D livestream platform and the physical platform installation, NDSM FUSE, October, 2020</div></div></div><br />\n<p><br />\nThe H&amp;D livestream platform converges an open-source streaming software, a streaming service, and a chat interface.<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Certainly less clumsy \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 platforms do exist. The H&amp;D livestream platform \u2018acted up\u2019 and caused moments of discomfort through its glitches and lags. However, it sustained its appearance, and has hosted many online H&amp;D events in different contexts.\n</p><p>In the context of H&amp;D, the collective seems to establish intrinsic relationships with digital tools and technical infrastructures that expand the realm of utility. An important part of building and maintaining such relationships are the manners in which the collective copes with unreliability, exercising patience and curiosity towards unintended technical glitches. In such a context, platforms can therefore not be described as self-contained entities. They travel between a multiplicity of meanings and inhabit collective peculiarities, as they are designed and redesigned in action and through interaction, which, in my view, makes it impossible to uphold a user-designer distinction.\n</p><p>To recap, a self-organized collective such as H&amp;D shapes itself through technical infrastructures. In turn, technical infrastructures also continuously evolve with the collective, oftentimes in unpredictable ways. The emerging technical infrastructure around the aforementioned exhibition project is an example of that. Through their co-evolvement with collective practice, such platforms can therefore not be described as disconnected from collectivity.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-22\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-22\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Hackers &amp; Designers is a non-profit workshop\u21b5 initiative organizing activities at the intersection of technology, design, and art.

Public time is measured in the presence of witnesses, whereby humans and/or material things (recording devices and documents) serve as and certify evidence or proof.&#160;In an art practice, public time includes both the time needed for preparing an event or action and the event or action itself, which are made visible to and shared by an audience, either live and/or through media registration.\n</p><p>The term public time is relevant for the notion of parrhesia\u2014meaning the courage to speak one\u2019s mind\u2014and for parrhesiastic practices, which I approach as exercises, understood in the ancient Greek context of <i>askesis</i> or disciplined practice. These exercises aim at finding the courage to speak one\u2019s mind by positioning and expressing oneself in relation to others. This happens through an expanded version of performativity that focuses on the right of the people (non-privileged as much as privileged) to \u2018appear\u2019 and on the potential of technology and virtual participation to enable the appearance of these bodies. In the field of art, parrhesiastic practices often reveal uncomfortable truths about conventions by undoing dignity and seriousness. They aim at engaging and affecting the spectator through various strategies, ranging from playful, friendly, and healing, to confrontational, disruptive, or aggressive. Unlike trolling phenomena taking place in online social communities, for the one who practices parrhesia this revealing of uncomfortable truths needs to be coupled with some kind of implication, engagement, self-exposure, and a sense of personal responsibility and shame. At that very moment in which the parrhesiast speaks boldly, not only does he/she tackle truth and existing power relations, but also his/her own subjectivity. In finding the courage to examine one\u2019s self and by putting his/her beliefs to the test on a daily basis, the one who practices parrhesia is freed from previous experiences, prejudices, and forms of control imposed on him/her through the \u2018common opinion\u2019. In this sense the parrhesiast is constantly subjected to self-transformation and/or self-de/reconstruction.\n</p><p>In <i>Philosophy, Politics, Autonomy: Essays in Political Philosophy</i> (1991), Greek-French philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis defines public time in a historiographic sense and discusses parrhesia in relation to the \u2018project of autonomy.\u2019 Two roots exist within the Greek word autonomy: autos (\u03b5\u03b3\u03ce \u03bf \u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 = myself) and nomos (law). An autonomous person creates his/her own law. Castoriadis argues that the first political society in which the citizens took the responsibility for their way of living and for legislatory regulations of social relations was in Ancient Greece. He posits that the possibility to ask questions as an individual or a group regarding social institutions\u21b5 occurred for the first time in Athens in the fifth century BCE. In this tradition, citizens contribute to the creation of public space (and public time) through the co-existence of three necessary and decisive phenomena: courage (<i>parrhesia</i>), responsibility (<i>euthini</i>), and shame (<i>aidos</i>, <i>aischune</i>).\n</p><p>In my presentation at the Making Matters Symposium (November 2020), I considered Etherpad as a tool for co-creating public time. Between February 16 and March 21, 2021, Thalia Hoffman (TH) and myself (EK) further discussed the term.\n</p><p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Public\">Public</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Public_time&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-2\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Public_time&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Who is the public? \u2018Public\u2019 here is an adjective defining the type of time. But indeed, who is the public in the case of a public artistic event? Is this type of open participation enough to create a shared sense of collectivity among the participants? What does a shared sense of collectivity contain? I suggest each participant needs to see/feel their contribution to the collective\u2026which can be at the same time seen/felt/inspected by the collective body\u21b5 of participants, enhancing in this way an understanding of individual contribution as responsibility. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Time\">Time</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Public_time&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-3\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Public_time&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Etherpad is an open-source online text editor. Each user\u2019s contributions are indicated by a colour code and are recorded onscreen in real time. Unlike discussions in a physical gathering (where unspoken communication expressed through facial expressions and bodily gestures\u21b5 accompanies words) or cloud-based platforms\u21b5 for video conferencing (where participants stare at each other\u2019s faces, talking heads videos arranged next to each other) communicating through the pad takes place purely on the level of ideas and the ability to relate mentally. Do only words communicate ideas? Words communicate ideas on the pad, but also something about the thinking process, the doubts and the hesitations involved in it: the movement of the interactions between our words, the time gaps, the mistakes, the erasures and re-writings. So maybe the pad (public space) needs to collect these gaps, doubts, and hesitations, and not erase them? It is not the pad that collects the gaps, doubts, and hesitations, but all participants together that make use of it to create this collection. But this is also what makes the pad a vulnerable tool for collecting content; any participant can erase the content with one click. Everyone can see what is written at the same time. The thought process is revealed, how thinking takes shape through typing. Does the typing change the thinking as well? Yes, the typing may change the thinking, provided one enters the pad in a state of mind open to change/dialogue, not set on a prefixed message one wishes to convey. I agree, being open for dialogue is needed many times for the possibility of change. I wondered though if the actual physical act of typing also changes the course of thinking. If we had a conversation with spoken words instead, would this change our thinking about concepts and ideas? I am not sure it would change our thinking about concepts, but there is this mechanical, repetitive aspect within the typing process that might interfere with one\u2019s course of thinking. It provokes people to react to each other on the spot. You type something and it is immediately there. Can this be described as performative writing? Yes! I feel we need to capture the \u2018liveness\u2019 of this performance. Something that reveals its becoming. Maybe recorded typing? Or performative co-typing that has the potential to be recorded? You can go back and erase it, but people can see this as everything is documented immediately. Online/digital media make it difficult to read each other, as the senses are limited to sight and hearing. Through this visualization of thought, it is feasible to collectively write and speak, to influence our thinking, to both witness and testify. I am interested in considering the pad as a tool for creating public time. Can it grasp collectivity in these times? Does collectivity need public time? or vice versa? Maybe they are interdependent? Collectivity needs public time to reflect on and inspect its own past actions, but also public time cannot exist without a collectivity. What do you think? I think there is an element of time that is always shared. What makes it public in the sense we are trying to capture here, is that the \u2018public\u2019 is doing something additional together during this time, something that is more than spending time together. Maybe we should ask what needs to happen in time to make it collective? I agree. Maybe it has to do with future decisions, actions, experiences that will have an effect on people, both individually and collectively.\n</p><p>Are we trying to create public space here? Since we are working on the same text but at separate times? I think what we are trying to do here is creating both public space <i>and</i> public time. This is how I became interested in Castoriadis, because he brings public time in the conversation as going hand-in-hand with the creation of public space. He finds these two indispensable for what he calls \u2018the project of autonomy\u2019* of Ancient Greek democracy. I connect this with my suggestion to connect the personal to the shared, and through that define the collectiveness of this time.\n</p><p>Can time be private? Yes. When I am daydreaming, reading a book, or drawing, I withdraw to a personal sense of time, and I don\u2019t feel the need to share this with others. But this happens within a \u2018bigger\u2019 time that is public and local. The personal sense of time is always part of the time of the day at the particular place where it occurs, meaning it is public and local. I also feel time is always private as much as it is public, even if I share time with others, there is always the way I sense the time we spend together. If \u2018public\u2019 goes hand in hand with being exposed/accessible to everyone, are obscure and concealed activities also part of public time?\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"zo.C3.B6p\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"zo\u00f6p\">zo\u00f6p</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Zo%C3%B6p&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Zo%C3%B6p&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Klaas Kuitenbrouwer</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Zoop.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/2/2d/Zoop.jpg/300px-Zoop.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"600\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/2/2d/Zoop.jpg/450px-Zoop.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/2/2d/Zoop.jpg/600px-Zoop.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Zoop.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Photo by Patricia de Ruijter \u2013 mediakaal.nl</div></div></div>\n<p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\n</p><p>The concept and practice of the Zo\u00f6p were developed between 2019 and 2021 by a network of artists, designers, philosophers, ecologists, and lawyers, initiated and led by Het Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam. Zo\u00f6p is short for zo\u00f6peration, a combination of the words cooperation and <i>zo\u00eb</i>, the Greek word for \u2018life\u2019. Zo\u00f6p is a new organizational model or legal entity that allows organizations of many kinds to collaborate with other-than-human life in their own operational sphere. Zo\u00f6p is intended as an attempt to begin with the work of repair amidst the present-day climate catastrophe and escalating ecological degradation. It is a pragmatic answer to the issue of capitalist realism\u2014i.e., the capitalist reductive understanding of the world as a collection of standardized commodities and scalable procedures. According to writer and cultural theorist Mark Fisher and philosopher Federico Campagna this understanding has become a metaphysics,<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> which led Fisher to the statement that \u2018[i]t is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-35\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The sound of the desperate voices of collectives of animals, plants, and other bodies alive today can be harsh to the senses, and it demands an effort and dedication to take those voices into account.<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> \n<br />The Zo\u00f6p way of working aims to concretize this effort. It has three goals: firstly, to strengthen the political and legal standing of other-than-human life within human capitalist societies. Secondly, to support ecological regeneration, in Zo\u00f6p vocabulary: Zo\u00f6ps want to develop the zo\u00f6nomy\u21b5 (a regenerative economy that secures the quality of life of multispecies collectivities) within and surrounding Zo\u00f6ps. Thirdly, the aim of the initiators is to make the Zo\u00f6p model widely adoptable and put into practice by a variety of organizations, from farms to municipalities, from hotels to cemeteries, from commercial enterprises to non-profit organizations.&#160;The Zo\u00f6p model is the centrepiece of the Zo\u00f6p movement and shapes anchoring bodies for the larger practice of zo\u00f6nomy\u21b5.\n</p><p>In order to facilitate the development of the Zo\u00f6p movement, two legal bodies have been founded in 2022. One is the Zo\u00f6nomic Institute. Its task is to help organizations to transform themselves into Zo\u00f6ps. It grants organizations the right to call themselves Zo\u00f6ps. The other one is the Zo\u00f6nomic Foundation. As laid down in its statutes, the Zo\u00f6nomic Foundation has one task only: to articulate and represent the needs and interests of other-than-human life in the spatial and operational domain of Zo\u00f6ps and to translate these into organizational decision making.\n</p><p>Organizations that turn into a Zo\u00f6p keep their existing function\u2014a school remains a school, a farm remains a farm, a hotel a hotel\u2014but set themselves an additional goal, which is to foster zo\u00f6nomy\u21b5. An organization can be be accredited as Zo\u00f6p<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> by doing two things: first it grants the Zo\u00f6nomic Foundation an observer seat on its board (or whatever body in charge of its policies). This seat is then filled by a human Speaker for the Living. The Speaker for the Living is bound to the statutes of the Zo\u00f6nomic Foundation and acts as the speculative and political organ for other-than-human life in the Zo\u00f6p. Secondly, the organization commits itself to follow the Zo\u00f6nomic annual cycle, by which it gradually transforms its operation, intervention by intervention, into a regenerative practice that collaborates with other-than-human life and gives it space and opportunity to find quality of life.\n</p><p>The development of the Zo\u00f6p concept was inspired by the now famous Rights of Nature cases of Whanganui river, Mount Taranaki, and Te Urewera forest. These three collective other-than-human bodies are the living ancestors of different New Zealand Iwi, tribes of the Maori, New Zealand\u2019s indigenous people. The river, mountain, and forest were granted legal personhood in the New Zealand jurisdiction between 2014 and 2017. In legal terms, they became incorporated other-than-humans. Whenever necessary, they are represented by human members of their respective Iwi.\n</p><p>In Western cultural tradition, collective bodies\u21b5 of other-than-humans do not have the status of ancestors. In fact, they are not even considered subjects, but resources, which caused the ecological disaster we find ourselves in. Although there is a growing movement of Rights of Nature legal and other activists, the legislative reform by which living other-than-humans should gain rights will be slow and thorny.\n</p><p>The Zo\u00f6p organizational format does not require the legislative reform that rights of nature require, but uses existing instruments of private law. Zo\u00f6p does not grant rights or personhood to living other-than-human entities but operates on the premise of them already having rights. Zo\u00f6p is intended as a way of organizing, a practice, a procedure that actively acknowledges these rights and the subjective experience of other-than-human life. It is focused on collaboration between human and other-than-human life. In this sense, the Zo\u00f6p model is a pragmatic shortcut to a Rights of Nature practice as it is established in the jurisdictions of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Uganda, India and many more countries, besides New Zealand.<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>With the governance structure and the Zo\u00f6nomic Foundation in place, a Zo\u00f6p, commits itself to figuring out how its operation can transform itself into a regenerative practice, contributing to the quality of life of a human inclusive ecology. It does so by following the Zo\u00f6nomic annual cycle of four movements, called Demarcating, Observing &amp; Sensing, Characterizing and Intervening.<sup id=\"cite_ref-39\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Demarcating answers the question: which (legal, human, organizational, and other-than-human) bodies form the Zo\u00f6p?<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Demarcating situates the Zo\u00f6p\u2019s practice in its environment and articulates its locally specific questions for actual \u2018collective bodies\u21b5\u2019.\n</p><p>Observing &amp; Sensing is concerned with understanding the life-worlds of the different bodies that make up a Zo\u00f6p, and with the question of whether and how those bodies perceive and acknowledge each other\u2019s Zo\u00f6p participation.\n</p><p>Characterizing involves asking the question how the different bodies enhance or obstruct each other\u2019s quality of life. This will result in a first kind-of-diagnosis of the Zo\u00f6p\u2019s ecological integrity and exploration of interventions.\n</p><p>Intervening, then, is the process of actually changing the spatial arrangements, organizational practice or relational fabric of a Zo\u00f6p. Its primary objective is a local, thriving, combined human and other-than-human community that provides groundwork for other, more global aspects of the transformation of economy into zo\u00f6nomy\u21b5.\n</p><p>At the time of writing, more than twenty organizations (farms, cultural institutions\u21b5, holiday parks, educational institutions\u21b5 and others) have committed themselves to becoming a Zo\u00f6p. On 22 April 2022, Earth Day, Het Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam has become the first actual Zo\u00f6p in the world.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-34\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-34\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Federico Campagna, <i>Technic &amp; Magic: The Reconstruction of Reality</i> (London, etc.: Bloomsbury Academic, 2018).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-35\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-35\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Mark Fisher, <i>Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?</i> (Hampshire: John Hunt Publishing, 2009).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-36\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-36\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Eva Meijer, <i>Dierentalen</i> (Leusden: ISVW Uitgevers, 2020).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-37\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-37\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">So, by the Zo\u00f6nomic Institute, the central hub of the zo\u00f6p movement.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-38\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-38\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">See for instance www.therightsofnature.org/what-is-rights-of-nature/.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-39\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-39\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">zoop.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/instruments-methods.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-40\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-40\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Adopted and expanded from Elinor Ostrom\u2019s principles for managing commons <u><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons\">www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commons</a>.</u></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n</div>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"critique\">critique</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=4\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: critique\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: critique\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<div class=\"chapter chapter-critique\" id=\"chapter-critique\">\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"criticality\">criticality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Frans-Willem Korsten</span>\n</p><p>criticality has been defined first and foremost within Marxist and post-structuralist frames, as an attitude and a praxis that aims to scrutinize and dismantle the dichotomies and hierarchies set up by ruling powers. Whereas these frames were philosophically inclined, other forms of criticality were more practical. Often as a mix of both, distinct approaches were developed under the heading of, for instance, \u2018critical pedagogy\u2019, \u2018critical geography\u2019, or critical making\u21b5. The following case offers different modalities of the term. The case concerns a public primary school, located close to a train station in Utrecht, a major city in the Netherlands. This had been the school\u2019s location since 1883. Children from lower and middle social classes had attended it, from a distinctly multicultural populace in the last decades of the twentieth century. Then, in the late 1990s, it had to make way for an office building, the so-called Klundertoren, named after the architect who designed it. The artwork on top of it from 2003, by Jan van Munster, reads IK\u2014Dutch for \u2018I\u2019.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Inktpot.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/da/Inktpot.jpg/300px-Inktpot.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/da/Inktpot.jpg/450px-Inktpot.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/da/Inktpot.jpg/600px-Inktpot.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Inktpot.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Gezicht op het kantoorgebouw de Inktpot van ProRail (Moreels...

The renovation would partly be paid for by the real estate developer of the Klundertoren. After a disastrous process of moving the school into a building of which the renovation was not finished, the responsible councillor decided two years later that the school would have to move again, to make way for another X-tower. At this point, a group of parents said \u2018no\u2019. Without knowing it at the time, they opposed a development project that involved an estimated investment of around 50 million euros. In a sense, they were critically unaware.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1._experiencing_criticality\">1. experiencing criticality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-2\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Battles like these take a lot of time. One question is how long people are prepared to keep on fighting and stick together. For a real estate developer, five years, or ten years, or even fifteen years is nothing. On the contrary, years may add to profit. Let\u2019s call this the critical limit of perseverance. In this case, the battle would take five years.\n</p><p>Real estate developers may, on the face of it, function within the limits of the law, but are often closely allied with parties that do not. First, there were two clumsy, nightly attempts to set the listed building containing the school on fire. Then, during a gymnastics class of six- and seven-year-olds in the gym on the first floor, the stairway leading up to the gym was set on fire, as well as the doors to the emergency exit. An astute teacher grabbed a bench, pushed it through the window and helped the children escape via the roof of the neighbouring building. Let us call this the criticality of the situation.\n</p><p>In a civil society, this is serious business. Now that their children had been brought into a life-threatening situation by an unknown actor, the parents might have decided to give up. Yet the burned shoes of the children that had been left before the door of the gym inspired them to contact the mayor, who in the Dutch system is in charge of the police. When the responsible councillor told the city council what had happened, there was a strange, chilling silence that had its political effect. The school was granted the permission to stay, and the building would be properly renovated. A fourth attempt to set it on fire did not have the desired effect either. As the council had taken its official decision, the critical moment had passed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2._practicing_criticality\">2. practicing criticality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-3\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the case at hand, criticality consisted in the determination to take everything that the councillor or officials were saying as a subject of research, and to follow the money. It took the collective of parents two years of in-depth research, involving all the legal possibilities to acquire the necessary information, to find out that this specific school had to be removed because it was part of a substantial number of public-school buildings that were going to be sold and converted into apartment buildings. The funds thus obtained provided the municipality with the money needed for concentrating the city\u2019s entire vocational education in three new buildings. The latter may be a worthy cause. The question was why the money had to be found at the cost of public schooling, and at the cost of political and ethical transparency. The school buildings to be sold were often located in urban environments that over the past years had become impressively expensive, due to gentrification and economic developments. The municipality had to negotiate all sorts of agreements with real estate developers, who do not tend to spend public money cautiously and often operate in the shadows rather than in the full light of public scrutiny.\n</p><p>In response, the collective of parents decided to operate in the open. Every step they took was documented on a website: every plan, every letter, all arguments. When at some point the councillor tried to contact a member of the collective (me), and this parent engaged in a personal mail conversation, the parent was corrected by a good friend, also part of the collective, who was able to follow the conversation. And rightly so. It was a mail conversation that, because of its personal character, could easily lead to unofficial agreements, on the side, in the shadows, threatening the very transparency that was at stake. criticality involved the scrutiny of what others were saying and doing, and the attempt to be as open as possible to the critical assessment by others.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"3._an_ethics_of_criticality\">3. an ethics of criticality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-4\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Though the collective as a whole did not use the term explicitly, criticality proved to be a matter of defining it through praxis. During the height of the struggles, the collective would meet every two weeks, and discuss what to do, how to do it, and what not to do. Few parents involved had read Derrida, but in a sense, all were involved in a process of deconstruction since deconstruction is not something enforced <i>upon</i> something, but is always already at work in something, whether a text or situation. The <i>doxa</i> of real estate development and city council was already deconstructing itself through discursive cracks or contradictions that were made visible in the critical documentation process of the parents. It is helpful to re-read Derrida about the concept of deconstruction, here:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>... deconstruction is neither an analysis nor a critique and its translation would have to take that into consideration. It is not an analysis in particular because the dismantling of a structure is not a regression toward a simple element, toward an indissoluble origin. \u2026 No more is it a critique, in a general sense or in Kantian sense. The instance of <i>krinein</i> or of <i>krisis</i> (decision, choice, judgment, discernment) is itself, as is all the apparatus of transcendental critique, one of the essential \u2018themes\u2019 or \u2018objects\u2019 of deconstruction.<sup id=\"cite_ref-41\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The quote helps us first of all to distinguish between critique and criticality. The first connotes the ability to decide, choose, judge, discern. The second connotes the fact that decisions, choices, judgments, and discernments are precisely the object or theme of deconstruction. The core of the struggle for the school was not to prove the municipality or its real estate allies wrong, but to show how the process of decision-making had been full of uncritical decisions, choices, judgments, and discernments. Secondly, it is worthwhile noting that the quote comes from a letter addressed to Toshihiko Izutsu, an expert on Zen Buddhism and Sufism, with a great interest in Truth (<i>Satori</i>, or Enlightenment). This truth, according to Izutsu, cannot be grasped by reason or language, nor can it be taught or understood intellectually.<sup id=\"cite_ref-42\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> It can only be a matter of praxis and process. Truth can never be discovered, then, although it can be momentarily experienced.\n</p><p>The fight for the school was not a spiritual matter. Or was it, at least in part? If criticality was involved, it consisted in the desire to work towards truth\u2014a truth that had two modalities. One the one hand it concerned a process of criticality during which, in a certain sense, truth was found: the financial reality of agreements between the municipality, big educational institutions\u21b5 and real estate developers. This truth does matter, as it may (but need not) increase the force of arguments. Yet it remains superficial without the veracity of a process, where truth is not to be discovered but to be experienced. Let\u2019s call this the ethics of criticality.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"4._the_situatedness_of_criticality\">4. the situatedness of criticality</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-5\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Criticality&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The specific case stands for a more general state of affairs. On all levels of government, the Dutch state has retreated from public tasks in the context of neo-liberal deregulation, propelled by the idea that \u2018the market\u2019 (a fiction) will do things better (a lie).\n</p><p>critical making\u21b5, in this context, with its focus on diy\u21b5 modes of making, holds a promise and a potential to serve the needs and desires of a multiplicity of people. In a sense, the entire struggle for the school was a matter of a political diy\u21b5. If the city council, if the councillor, if all sorts of public officials lack the agency or determination to adequately take care of public matters and public money, this provokes a diy\u21b5 response.\n</p><p>Situatedness is of critical importance. The current form of capitalism is interested in anything that can make the system even more flexible, resulting in less stability for citizens, fewer rights, less care for labourers of all sorts. What is called deregulation often comes down to fuzzy forms of responsibility that make it difficult to follow money flows. The history of the Italian <i>precario bello</i> has been considered as a case in point. When in the seventies \u2018playing\u2019 and \u2018not sticking to the rules\u2019 became an important tool to deregulate state power, the economic response was that, <i>hey!</i>, playing and not sticking to the rules can be used to reconfigure labourers or employees, demanding them to become ever more creative in ever more precarious circumstances. Consequently, if diy\u21b5 was an instrument of the empowerment of people in the first instance, it also is a form that, in certain situations, can be cheaply appropriated or used as an excuse for more deregulation.\n</p><p>criticality, in this context, means the full awareness of a situation, an awareness of what is at stake, an awareness of the alternatives one is looking for in a forcefield dominated by others. It concerns the perseverance to critically assess what powers in charge are doing, and requires a practice of transparency that leaves one open to the criticality of others.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-41\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-41\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Jacques Derrida, \u2018Letter to a Japanese Friend\u2019, in <i>Derrida and Difference</i>, ed.

When my practice was embedded in West Den Haag<sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> (see embeddedness\u21b5), one of my main questions became how to practice criticality\u21b5 from a position of proximity. When thinking about criticality\u21b5, my frame of reference is shaped by a.pass. a.pass is an educational platform\u21b5 for artistic research based in Brussels (Belgium), where I participated in the post-graduate programme, and where I am currently involved as an Associate Researcher. Lilia Mestre is the artistic coordinator at a.pass. In the following, we will engage in a conversation to tease out what it actually is for us, this criticality\u21b5. In preparation for our talk, we read an interview with Karen Barad,<sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> which we will refer to throughout our conversation.\n</p><p>Lilia, can you maybe start by saying how you think criticality\u21b5 is practiced at a.pass?\n</p><p><b>Lilia Mestre:</b> We practice it in many ways. I don\u2019t think we are very interested in critique as an end in itself, so it\u2019s not about finding some weak spots that are most suitable for deconstruction. That would be a somewhat reductionist concept of criticality\u21b5. I do think that how we approach criticality\u21b5 entails deconstruction, but as a means of understanding the complexity that propositions bring to the fore. What kind of clusters, lines and apparatuses surround practices, performances, texts, and research and how and what do they produce as meaning?\n</p><p>I like the idea of consciousness as put forward by Karen Barad, as a conscious critical view; something that creates awareness could be called critical, right? Criticality\u21b5 can be seen as a skill or a tool that develops a set of antennas\u2014maybe antennas is a good metaphor. Seen this way, criticality\u21b5 becomes a sensitive tool, responsive to what is proposed. I see criticality\u21b5 as the desire to understand how to be involved.\n</p><p><b>PL:</b> When I look up the etymology of \u2018critic\u2019 or \u2018critique\u2019, it leads to the Greek word krinein \u2018to separate, decide\u2019 which comes from a root that translates as \u2018to sieve\u2019, thus \u2018discriminate, distinguish\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-45\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> So, it\u2019s an interaction with an apparatus that makes a selection, or distinguishes. Funny actually, the two-slit experiment that Karen Barad bases her theory on is a sieving experiment as well, literally. It\u2019s the sieving that causes a diffraction pattern. According to Barad, studying the experiment doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the thing that you sieve, but you will know something about the phenomenon, which is the sieving plus the thing that came out.\n</p><p><b>LM:</b> Perhaps the understanding of the apparatus, whether a two-slit sieve or an artwork, makes visible what the performativity of the apparatus itself is. It\u2019s like a mise-en-scene of the apparatus. As in the apparatus of theatre, which contains the setting, the scenario, the operation itself including the audience.\n</p><p><b>PL:</b> There\u2019s this really beautiful part in Barad\u2019s book,<sup id=\"cite_ref-46\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-46\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> where she wonders where the apparatus ends, and describes how there are no edges to it. Even the person seeing that mise-en-scene is part of the apparatus, the building that we\u2019re in is part of the apparatus, the printer that prints out the result is part of the apparatus, the people that funded the whole thing are part of it, the people sweeping the hallway. When you see things this way, there\u2019s this constant expansion.\n</p><p>For me criticality\u21b5 holds this tension exactly, of a noting of difference and selection on the one hand, and constant expansion through awareness on the other. The selection or cut that it makes causes things to appear, and excludes other things.\n</p><p>Can you give an example how this resonates in a.pass?\n</p><p><b>LM:</b> In a.pass, the participants are invited to be part of the institutional apparatus, somehow. They are part of the development of the practices generated in the institution\u21b5. We practice it in the sense that a.pass is not a stable structure. We have many institutional questions that arise from the participants\u2019 practices. We can take this one: \u2018what is criticality\u21b5?\u2019 and your invitation to write together. If we dig into this: How is this going to change our relations? Not just the existing relationship between the two of us but also the relation between the institutions\u21b5 that are part of this publication, like West, the Workgroup and all the others participating. I think that a.pass as an institution\u21b5 is shaped through the research practices that are present each moment, but also through how people deal with them and what their desire for criticality\u21b5 is, how much they want to move through it or not. The capacity of listening. The desire to be confronted or not. I think all these things are determining what happens in a.pass and how content and infrastructures of research are interwoven.\n</p><p><b>PL:</b> This idea that one can participate as a mode of criticality\u21b5, the idea of becoming part of the apparatus, is something that I clearly recognize as a practice in a.pass. In art education on often finds practices of critique for which the intentions of the artist have to be determined, to compare them to the work that either deviates from or falls in line with that intention. I was thinking that what seems different to me in the forms of feedback and critique that I experienced in a.pass, is the invitation to participate. I think Vladimir<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> once explained it to me as treating the group, or thinking of the group as a sort of extension of your body as a researcher, in that you are really invited into the apparatus. In turn you always consider how you invite others into your work, making them part of it. It takes away the illusion of the object of critique as separate from yourself as a participatory subject.\n</p><p><b>LM:</b> The sense of participation in the context of criticality\u21b5 is also very important if we think about the audience that we want to address. Let\u2019s say that art is like the spectacle of phenomena, right; art exposes a certain phenomenon in certain conditions and invites people to attend through the conditions provided. I want the invitation, for me as an audience member, to be similar to the one that you described. I want to be able to participate, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean active participation. But I want to know what is the invitation for me to respond and let feelings, emotions, thoughts, whatever it wants to create with me, appear. This is the potential of modifying it already, or at least to be able to be responsive to it.\n</p><p>How do you do that in your practice?\n</p><p><b>PL:</b> As you know I\u2019m very present in my work and my practice, as a subject that is an object as well. So, I read everything both through myself and with a kind of distance. I see myself as practicing institutional critique, but it is inherently a critique of myself as part of the institution\u21b5 or situation. This way I hope to invite others to consider their institutional entanglements as well.\n</p><p><b>LM:</b> This is hard and very interesting work, because ultimately, you see yourself as an apparatus already, right, with a structure that conditions your power position, paradoxes, problems, and alliances. I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that objects of study are complex objects and include the self and its context and background, including social class, gender, race, economic support, species, and so on.\n</p><p>The question is then: How can we create a soft distance which is set artificially, so it\u2019s a real artificial one (because what the hell is real?) that enables criticality\u21b5? This refers back to the baboon anecdote in the interview with Barad. A researcher of baboons decided to pretend to be a baboon\u2014pretending became a tool to get in touch with her object of research, and actually be more objective.\n</p><p>I like to think of it as friendship (see artificial friendship\u21b5). Friendship opens to the possibility of diffraction, as Barad calls it. Then criticality\u21b5 is not just about choosing or making distinctions, but it enables an accumulative process of relations that are critical in themselves. In the sense that one can think of criticality\u21b5 itself as being a friend. Curious friends give you tools, open and close doors for elements that are already part of it, right, that you are already entangled with but have not seen yet.\n</p><p><b>PL:</b> I\u2019m starting to realize now that this is a mode of making, for me. Practicing criticality\u21b5 creates so much material, all the time, and for me it is exciting to simply re-stage it in the place where I found it. It\u2019s like Barad\u2019s description of the expanded apparatus. To be with something and seeing, activating all your antennas, while taking into account how you are part of it, creates a kind of generative feedback loop, an abundance, in every singular situation. This is both a mode of criticality\u21b5 and source of creativity, if I may be so romantic to use that word. Now we\u2019re back to a.pass, because I think it\u2019s something that I got from you since you use this expression a lot, but it also really does \u2018open up\u2019\u2014a continuous folding and unfolding.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-43\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-43\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">West Den Haag, exhibition space in The Hague, www.westdenhaag.nl.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-44\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-44\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Rick Dolphijn and Iris van der Tuin, \u2018Matter Feels, Converses, Suffers, Desires, Yearns and Remembers.

The concept of return beat\u21b5 refers to a mode of resonant experience of rhythmic perceptions that is culturally shared and cyclical in nature.\n</p><p>The return beat is transmitted through a praxis I refer to as the Golden Triangle, which uses rhythm as a vehicle that integrates song or spoken word with movement or dance and with percussion or drumming. This integrated triple praxis is then used as a starting point to experience individual and cultural modes of being, becoming, and performance as part of a perception of a plethora of living forces of planet Earth.\n</p><p>Principally, the return beat is a rhythmic paradigm that underpins the embodied knowledge of both Pan African people, in other words people who live on the African continent and people of the Pan African cultural diaspora, who are people of African descent living outside the continent. This embodied knowledge applies a traditional fractal aesthetic in the creation and production of temporal space. This traditional African aesthetic is binary in nature and manifests as endless bifurcations of single pathways. It can be identified in weaving patterns, traditional ornamentation of buildings and utensils, but also in certain images that the mathematician Mandelbrot created to visualize so-called fractals. It observes as well as expresses the continuous twinning process that is required for living bodies to propagate in the world. This aesthetics not only depicts patterns, it also includes the agency of a living body to navigate them, to choose a single pathway in those bifurcating spaces.\n</p><p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"return_beat_and_physical_journal.E2.86.B5\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"return_beat_and_physical_journal\u21b5\">return beat and physical journal\u21b5</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=ReturnBeat&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-2\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=ReturnBeat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>physical journal\u21b5 is a way to conceptualize living bodies from the perspective of a practitioner\u2019s lived experience. The physical journal\u21b5 is formed by both genetically and culturally embodied memories that neurologically construct a kind of virtual body, which is holographically projected as our experience of being a lived body. The physical journal\u21b5 is an intertwined set of embodied spatial memories that act as reference frame for living bodies to write and rewrite themselves through experience. It is the spatialized memory of the body itself that acts both as counterpoint for new experiences and as the spatial fabric where these experiences are being inscribed.\n</p><p>The return beat draws attention to the temporal location of the beats as well as the spaces between the beats, as experienced in relation to the physical journal\u2019s\u21b5 encounter with the rhythmic flow, The phenomenon of return beat is a specific cultural experience of tempo and its flow within any given rhythm, which is the nature of the beat itself. The resonant embodied understanding of the return beat\u21b5 is experienced as a curve leading back to the individual\u2019s sense of self, being, and awareness. By echoing the metabolic circular rhythm of our heartbeat, we create an outgoing (centrifugal) and a returning (centripetal) experience pertaining to the duration between repetitive beats. These beats are perceived to emerge from visceral pathways in our embodied experience.\n</p><p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"away_from_static_temporal_space\">away from static temporal space</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=ReturnBeat&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-3\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=ReturnBeat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Western temporal-spatial understanding describes repetition as static patterns in duration. This understanding, which neglects the experiencing-performing body and limits itself to repetitive phenomena in a fixed and passive temporal arena, subjugated the Yoruba perspective. It ridiculed the transformative potential of repetition, constraining the understanding of what is rhythmically repetitious and discarding it as unevolved and predictable.\n</p><p>Through this Westerns lens, the concept of a return beat\u21b5 that mobilizes notions of returning to the same experience in distributed regions of time-space, may produce an embodied fear of stagnation. However, if we move away from the disembodied, static perceptions of temporal space\u2014a perceptual hangover from dualism in the Enlightenment\u2014to a more dynamic quantum perception that includes the living body, then repetition does not unfold in stasis but in pulses and waves. Temporal space is then not an empty arena for events to unfold but a substance that contains and yields energy.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Returnbeat.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/f/f6/Returnbeat.png/300px-Returnbeat.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/f/f6/Returnbeat.png/450px-Returnbeat.png 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/f/f6/Returnbeat.png/600px-Returnbeat.png 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Returnbeat.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Black lines are the curve flux of experience with the dashed lines representing an outgoing centrifugal experience of the curve flux with the solid line representing the returning centripetal experience.

Some notions that I have scavenged from the margins of business discourse open up wormholes to new understandings. Management professor Martin Parker calls for an \u2018insurgent entrepreneurship\u2019 that could be critical, experimental, and playful with the economic status quo.<sup id=\"cite_ref-49\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-49\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Activist lawyer Janelle Orsi asks what would happen if we redefined enterprise as \u2018any productive activity that could bring us sustenance\u2019?<sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-50\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Social innovation scholar Warren Nilsson offers a gravitational vision of \u2018unbound\u2019 organization: an alternative geometry where business could have \u2018a centre but no sides\u2019, its activities coordinated through human intentions and relations, not formal structures and agendas.<sup id=\"cite_ref-51\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-51\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> And in the context of critical making\u21b5, social entrepreneur Matthew Manos has speculated on \u2018business as a medium for critical inquiry\u2019 where the formats and materials of business could be refocused towards meaning-making rather than market-based success.<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-52\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> A pi\u00f1ata of possibilities, yet the wider opportunity glimpsed in these statements is that business might not be a done deal, but open to interpretation.\n</p><p>In my own case, I have been working as an artist with business as my medium and material for almost twenty years. My first foray into commerce was with feral\u21b5 Trade, a sole trader grocery business operating across mixed terrain of art, social networks, and the commodity sphere since 2003 (for a more detailed description, see the entry for feral\u21b5 in this lexicon). I am also a part of the Cube Cola manufacturing partnership that produces and distributes an open-source cola worldwide. The cola is produced in our kitchen \u2018lab\u2019 and mailed out to customers in concentrate form; the recipe is freely shared. And I am a member of the accounts team at the Cube Microplex in Bristol, an all-volunteer-run arts venue that makes its living from the bar and the door takings. These endeavours are not proudly independent but rather the opposite, they make and maintain their interdependence with a constellation of other enterprises, from corporates to colleagues. These are the waste collectors, the regulatory agencies, the flavour industry giants, but they are also the corner shopkeepers, smallholder farms, feminist server collectives and diy\u21b5 shipping lines. To mention just a few like-minded endeavours, Company Drinks in London describe themselves as \u2018art in the shape of a community drinks enterprise\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-53\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-53\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> They run a yearly production cycle making and trading fizzy drinks in their community, a form of collectivity in art and economy they claim as a new and vital form of public space. And there is the Sail Cargo Alliance, a Europe-wide gathering of wind-powered sailing vessels, ships captains, and cargo brokers who are assembling a grassroots freight system that challenges not only the fuel source but the logic of the whole supply chain, down to what would be traded and why. Critically, these endeavours are not doing art or activism \u2018about\u2019 business but are out there in the world doing business for real.\n</p><p>Taking business as a stage and site for experiments in \u2018surviving well together\u2019 (in the words of feminist economist J.K. Gibson-Graham),<sup id=\"cite_ref-54\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-54\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> the kind that might open up routes into other possible worlds, may seem counter-intuitive. Those working in the arts or education may have experienced being swept up or perhaps dragged under by a tide of business vocabulary and values, encapsulated in the bonanza of the Creative Industries that reconfigures creativity as a driver of economic growth. At the same time, the uneasy covenant that \u2018business as usual\u2019 would maintain a habitable planet has unarguably failed. Yet these fractures and fissures also point to an uncommon potential. business is widely understood and accessible, it operates in and across wildly different collectives, shapes, and scales. It can act as a Trojan horse, an avatar or exoskeleton in which to navigate this hostile yet contestable space that we hazily call \u2018the economy\u2019. The sail cargo captains are negotiating with commercial harbours to bring their vessels into port alongside the container ships. The artist-led drinks companies are merging their recipes to produce a trans-national cola with the potential to take down a stickily secretive, world-dominating incumbent. An artist-anarchist farming partnership finds a route through the welfare system to secure the Farm Household Allowance, an income that will bankroll their agriculture experiments for years to come.\n</p><p>In the case of feral\u21b5 Trade, a few years back I was fortunate enough to be raided by Trading Standards, the UK consumer protection agency. Trading Standards investigates commercial entities that trade outside the law, they have more powers than the police and can for example enter your home without a warrant. They spent hours swarming the feral\u21b5 Trade website, then cornered me for an interview. After lengthy negotiations, finding no consumer as such to protect\u2014these are peer-to-peer transactions, negotiated entirely through social routes and relations\u2014I received a kind of de facto, state-sanctioned permission to continue trading, in this grey zone of business that feral\u21b5 Trade has made its home. A tiny island of regulatory indeterminacy, where the relationship between the commercial and the personal is blurred to the point that the law gets a headache.\n</p><p>These are wildly local and contingent examples; they are not models for anything. They are all also imbricated, co-produced and co-dependent with a host of other elements and effects, including the systems they contest. Yet this is also the point. The prospect of business could not be more salient, viewed from the burning debris of a torched economy. We all already are, have, or are in a unit of livelihood, or many\u2014to annex the words of artist Joseph Beuys: \u2018everyone is a business\u2019! The challenge, and the potential, is to bring our day-to-day subsistence in line with the meanings we want to make. business could be a vehicle for doing that.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-48\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-48\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Try scanning the texts of your favourite philosopher, artist, or activist thinker for business and you might see what I mean.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-49\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-49\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\u2018Horizons of Possibility: Challenge Co-optation and Transformation\u2019, in Martin Parker et al., eds., <i>The Routledge Companion to Alternative Organization</i> (London: Routledge, 2013), pp. 359\u201372.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-50\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-50\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Janelle Orsi, <i>Practicing Law in the Sharing Economy: Helping People Build Cooperatives, Social Enterprise, and Local Sustainable Economies</i> (Chicago, IL, American Bar Association, 2012).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-51\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-51\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Warren Nilsson, <i>Organization Unbound: The Spiritual Architecture of Organizations</i> (2007).

H&amp;D workshops take place in a non-hierarchical manner, meaning that participants become workshop hosts and vice versa. The ways in which the workshop programme unfolds over the course of the Summer Academy is put up for discussion.\n</p><p>Our motivation for hosting\u21b5 a workshop on how to give a workshop was mostly to pay attention to the format of the workshop itself as it, so far, has remained mostly unquestioned as a format, even though it is a substantial ingredient of H&amp;D\u2019s activities. H&amp;D is only one of many similar initiatives that resort to the workshop as a format for organizing events. As an ambiguous format, not tied to a specific context, the workshop crosses many boundaries\u2014between art and activism, between different disciplines and institutions\u21b5, between commercial and educational contexts. My attempt at a definition is: a gathering of a committed group of people who want to learn something together in a set time frame. workshops that I have been part of usually follow a hands-on approach to learning that can be traced back to the Bauhaus. Here, the workshop was the artisan\u2019s workplace, a place that bridged the divide between making and thinking, as well as between disciplinary divisions such as sculpting and painting. The workshop brought together art and technology in an attempt to provide solutions for the social problems posed by an industrialized, capitalist society.<sup id=\"cite_ref-56\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-56\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>workshops like the ones organized at H&amp;D are not bound to any particular space. In this regard they differ from the artisan workshop, which is the site of material production. The workshop does not exclude the possibility for material production or skill transfer and there is a strong incentive to share knowledge and learning experiences through making things. However, making something is not necessarily regarded as a goal. On the contrary, a workshop may become an opportunity to escape the pressure of producing something final or instantaneously useful.<sup id=\"cite_ref-57\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-57\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Despite these differences, both the artisan workshop and what I would like to call the \u2018ephemeral workshop\u2019 (as described above) can be seen as social spaces within which material-based learning can take place.\n</p><p>Besides methods, techniques, tools, and protocols, workshops also bring about certain social dynamics that evolve from the particular composition of participants, as well as the context and conditions they find themselves in. Such \u2018moods\u2019 shift and slide and cause particular forms of production and knowledge to emerge, intervene or evaporate. workshop participants and workshop hosts together shape and reshape the dynamic present.\n</p><p>In the 1960s and 1970s the workshop evolved as an extra-curricular self-organized activity that resisted principles of art &amp; design schools such as disciplined and canon-based learning, hierarchies between teachers (instructors) over students (apprentices), as well as the commercialization of workshops to produce \u2018marketable\u2019 goods.\n</p><p>Since the 1990s the workshop format regained traction with a renewed interest in educational experimentation in the arts.<sup id=\"cite_ref-58\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-58\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Inspired by movements of the 1960s and 1970s such as the \u2018Free International University\u2019,<sup id=\"cite_ref-59\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-59\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> \u2018Anti University\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-60\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-60\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> or the \u2018Non-School\u2019,<sup id=\"cite_ref-61\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-61\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> the so-called educational turn<sup id=\"cite_ref-62\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-62\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> drew attention to collective research, paying attention to processes rather than objects or final outcomes.\n</p><p>Today, collaborative learning, critical pedagogy, and self-organization are still key principles for collective practices that do not abide by the stiff structures of educational and cultural institutions\u21b5. workshops organized today for instance by H&amp;D,<sup id=\"cite_ref-63\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-63\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Varia,<sup id=\"cite_ref-64\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-64\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Trojan Horse,<sup id=\"cite_ref-65\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-65\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Anhoek School,<sup id=\"cite_ref-66\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-66\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> or Parallel School<sup id=\"cite_ref-67\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-67\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> continue the legacy of ad hoc self-organization, defiant dilettantism, horizontal and collective learning-by-doing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-68\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-68\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, in our day, the workshop has also become a popular genre that functions well within the framework of a service economy. Situated between work and leisure the workshop\u2019s commercial potential is explored in the context of conferences, incubator programmes, and creative retreats. Taking place outside of the daily work routine, workshops ought to be fun while valorizing the participants\u2019 CV. The workshop has been co-opted by innovation labs and creative agencies and turned into a product itself. For example, <i>Next Nature</i>, a speculative design studio, sells a workshop-in-a-box.<sup id=\"cite_ref-69\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-69\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Here, the workshop takes on the format of a card game and is described as a \u20182-hour dynamic crash course [that] helps you to better understand and discuss technology\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-70\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-70\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> It might not be intended as such, but in my view this workshop-in-a-box could be read as a satire on workshops, as an ironic commentary on compulsive self-improvement, learning-by-doing and the pressure to participate in one workshop after the other. The implication of presenting a workshop as a product is that the workshop in and of itself is a highly productive format. What a product like the workshop-in-a-box lacks to address is the unpredictability of a workshop context. workshop moods that are essential to any workshop experience cannot be predetermined thus, cannot be turned into generic instructions that fit on a card.\n</p><p>In my experiencing there is no such thing as a guarantee for \u2018a perfect workshop\u2019. workshop chatter and workshop moods\u2014either friendly and warm or grouchy and agitated\u2014are core ingredients of a workshop situation, but hardly predictable. Still, I do believe that the workshop can be a meaningful tool. The workshop brings about temporary learning environments, in which making processes but also modes of being together are put up for discussion. workshop situations have challenged me in my lack of patience or my assumptions of what I regarded as productive or efficient. A workshop cannot be taken for granted or defined as a given format or medium, and therefore cannot guarantee any outcome. The workshop comes with the potential for confrontation as much as it can lead to long-lasting collaborations and friendships. A workshop situation may produce disruptions and reciprocal challenging of assumptions engrained in disciplinary habits of how we are practicing. Specific moments of transformation are evoked by making things together, in the \u2018here and now\u2019.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-55\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-55\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><u><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://hackersanddesigners.nl/s/Summer_Academy_2018/p/Work_the_Workshop\">hackersanddesigners.nl/s/Summer_Academy_2018/p/Work_the_Workshop</a>.</u></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-56\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-56\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">See Jeroen van den Eijnde, in <i>Materialization in Art &amp; Design (MAD)</i>, ed.

The term was coined to address something that does not yet\u21b5 exist, but needs to come into existence: a regenerative economy. But as long as this not-yet\u21b5-existing thing is portrayed as an economy, it will carry forward the sad genealogy of that word since the invention of mercantilism. zo\u00f6nomy intends to free \u2018economy\u2019 of its extractivist premises, both in language and in material practices\u21b5.\n</p><p>zo\u00f6nomy makes no fundamental distinction between a human economy and economies of other-than-human life. It sidesteps the near-fatal historical mistake of separating human and other-than-human existence. zo\u00f6nomy deals with networks of exchange of matter, energy, and meaning that sustain bodies of any kind.\n</p><p>Human economic activity should be reconsidered and transformed into a functioning, supportive zone of a larger zo\u00f6nomy. Consequently, it would no longer be capitalist. Zo\u00f6ps are a testing ground for putting zo\u00f6nomy into practice.\n</p><p>The practice of zo\u00f6nomy starts on the inside of late-capitalism (as an outside presently only exists in theory). At the same time, it conceptually surrounds and exceeds the latter's notion of economy by paying qualitative attention to detail, to movement, to beauty, to violence, in short, to other things than quantity and currency.\n</p><p>zo\u00f6nomy aims to address the poverty of the capitalist logic, i.e., its metaphysics of one-dimensional quantification. But the issue is not economy per se. zo\u00f6nomy includes material exchanges. Like economy in its predominant understanding, zo\u00f6nomy is a sphere of value. Contrary to mainstream economy, its concept of value cannot be reduced to single, quantifiable, abstracted commodities. Zo\u00f6nomic value is rooted in a multiplicity of life-worlds, in notions and experiences of variety and richness in relations. Zo\u00f6nomic understanding is about qualities of relation and form and pattern, aided by quantity only where relevant.\n</p><p>Zo\u00f6nomic understanding does not operate from a preconceived distinction between physical, material exchange on the one hand and informational or symbolic exchange on the other. In other words, it is not performing any categorical distinction between theory and practice. Zo\u00f6nomic knowledge lives in all semiotic hot zones: in the indexical exchanges of hormones and chemistry, in the iconic exchanges of empathy across bodies and species, and in the symbolic exchanges of stories and aggregated, distilled experience that, as it turns out, is not an exclusively human practice either.<sup id=\"cite_ref-71\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-71\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>There is not even a potential end state for the evolution of zo\u00f6nomic knowledge, as it needs to work from the perspectives of ever more, always different bodies. By this principle, zo\u00f6nomy is and will have to remain stubbornly open to widely divergent knowledge practices, including those from other-than-human life-worlds, whose realms of existence may only be accessible to human bodies' experience by way of extended metaphor.<sup id=\"cite_ref-72\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-72\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> (And who is to deny the vital role of metaphor in knowledge practices?)<sup id=\"cite_ref-73\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-73\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The reason we need zo\u00f6nomy is that under the pervasive semantics of capitalist economy, bodies are only informed by financial signs, designating capitalism's poverty. In opposition, the zo\u00f6nomy of a place includes its material, thermodynamic, and trophic relations, it includes exchanges of materials and energy, it includes symbolic, aesthetic exchanges: the various ways in which bodies inform and impress each other; how that which can be exchanged, translates from some bodies to some other bodies.\n</p><p>The practice of zo\u00f6nomy requires that all those proliferating relations are not separated from each other by jargons or institutional traditions, but are perceived and treated as part of the same ontologically flattened, but otherwise exuberantly multidimensional sphere. This means that zo\u00f6nomy as a knowledge practice hybridizes (conceptual) tools, lenses, ways of doing\u2014from ecology, thermodynamics, economy, cultural analysis, political science, the arts, design, indigenous cosmologies and practices, various older and more recent technologies\u2014hell, even quantum physics! And not in any particular order.\n</p><p>The aim of zo\u00f6nomy is to develop knowledge practice of bodies that are always collective bodies\u21b5. Applying zo\u00f6nomic tools and methods, these bodies will perform<sup id=\"cite_ref-74\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-74\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> a local, distinguishable zo\u00f6nomy. This zo\u00f6nomy is both a network of actants, with no clear centre or border,<sup id=\"cite_ref-75\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-75\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> as well as a finite volume, a sphere.<sup id=\"cite_ref-76\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-76\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Diverse bodies are enrolled in constituting a locally situated zo\u00f6nomy. This zo\u00f6nomy is not yet all-inclusive, it still has an inside and an outside. After all, we have to start somewhere.\n</p><p>Zo\u00f6nomic knowledge is developed and aggregated in response to particular, motivated curiosities of certain collective bodies\u21b5. Calling this knowledge an effect of curiosity is to say that there is no talk here of a grand theory of zo\u00f6nomy. There may never be such a theory and certainly not in what is understood as \u2018theory\u2019 today. zo\u00f6nomy faces its questions in the field and in the flesh, where there are always open windows, ground fog, creaking hinges and funny smells, membranes, hair roots.\n</p><p>zo\u00f6nomy not only has no grand theory, it also does not have a language of its own yet, although it for sure has a liking for biological metaphor. Best we can say is that at the moment, it is in a state of critical <i>making do\u2014</i>an ontological pidgin. The first actual Zo\u00f6ps that will speak this pidgin, will grow it into a proud creole.\n</p><p>The concept, the practice and the language of zo\u00f6nomy always have some particular task and are being shaped by performing this task. This task is always situated<sup id=\"cite_ref-77\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-77\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\u2014it is always a task, an urgency at hand in one or the other Zo\u00f6p. The knowledge practice of zo\u00f6nomy should be capable of adapting to this task at hand, while increasing its integrity, like bone, like nervous tissue. The work is to make it work.\n</p><p>The practice of zo\u00f6nomy fosters ecological integrity of multispecies communities, of collective bodies\u21b5. The practice starts with Zo\u00f6ps and their surroundings, and from there intends to spread, like a beneficial pandemic, across planet Earth.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-71\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-71\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Eduardo Kohn, <i>How Forests Think: Toward an Anthropology beyond the Human</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2013), pp. 38\u201342; and Eva Meijer, <i>When Animals Speak, Towards and Interspecies Democracy</i> (New York: New York University Press, 2019).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-72\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-72\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ian Bogost, <i>Alien Phenomenology or What It\u2019s Like to Be a Thing?</i> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2012), pp. 61\u201384</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-73\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-73\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">George Lakoff, <i>Women, Fire and Dangerous Things</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-74\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-74\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Kara Barad, \u2018Posthuman Performativity: Toward an Understanding of How Matter Comes to Matter\u2019, <i>Signs Journal of Women in Culture and Society</i> 28, no. 3 (2003), pp. 801\u201331.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-75\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-75\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Bruno Latour, \u2018Some Experiments in Arts and Politics\u2019, <i>e-flux journal</i> 23 (March 2011).</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-76\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-76\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ibid.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-77\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-77\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Donna Haraway, \u2018Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspectives\u2019, <i>Feminist Studies</i> 14, no. 3 (Autumn, 1988), pp. 575\u201399.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"chapter chapter-making\" id=\"chapter-making\">\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"making\">making</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=6\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: making\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Publishing:Making_Matters_Lexicon&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: making\">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"artistic_research\">artistic research</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Artistic_research&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Artistic_research&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Janneke Wesseling</span>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"history\">history</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Artistic_research&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-2\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Artistic_research&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>\u2018artistic research\u2019 is a major buzzword in the European art field, in education (art academies and universities) as well as in exhibition circuits (museums, galleries, and bienniales). The artist as researcher has become a commonly accepted figure, but was hardly known in the field of contemporary visual art some twenty years ago.\n</p><p>Recent as the phenomenon may be, its roots can be traced back to early twentieth-century art movements such as Surrealism (Bureau de recherches surr\u00e9alistes founded in 1925 by Andr\u00e9 Breton) and Marcel Duchamp, and especially to the 1960s and 1970s. artistic research in visual art is highly indebted to conceptual art as it manifested itself both in the US (Dan Graham, John Baldessari, Hans Haacke, Joseph Kosuth, to mention just a few) and in Europe (George Brecht, Marcel Broodthaers, Hanne Darboven). In conceptual art, theoretical reflection plays a pivotal role. According to the early conceptual artists, the art work cannot not be separated from the context of history and politics and in order to produce art it was regarded as essential for artists to politically and discursively engage with society. Not only did conceptual artists reflect on societal and political issues, but on art and the art practice itself. They regarded critical reflection on one\u2019s artistic procedures or doings as essential to the artistic process or <i>as</i> the artistic process itself. Language and text therefore acquired an important role in art practice and writings could be part of the art work or even constitute the work itself (such as in the case of Robert Barry, Kosuth and the early work of Lawrence Weiner).\n</p><p>Another important factor in the emergence of theory and criticism as artistic practice were feminist art practices that aimed to reveal power structures and patterns of hierarchy in society and in the art world (Elaine Sturtevant, Louise Lawler, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger).\n</p><p>For present-day artists, to position themselves as researcher rather than as a producer of marketable goods offers an alternative to the dominance of economic liberalism in the art field and to the capitalist exploitation that is tied to the production of goods. The artist-as-researcher problematizes, contextualizes, and re-enacts social, political, and environmental issues.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"terminology\">terminology</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Artistic_research&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-3\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Artistic_research&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Artistic research could simply be defined as research carried out by artists (designers, composers, choreographers etc.)<sup id=\"cite_ref-78\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-78\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> It is practice-based research that is carried out in and through artistic practice.<sup id=\"cite_ref-79\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-79\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In artistic research, practical action (making) and theoretical reflection (thinking) go hand-in-hand, action and thought are inextricably linked. This type of research does not have a predetermined methodology. Like art practice, each artistic research project is idiosyncratic by nature, determined by the desire of the researcher to reflect on their practice, in collaboration with others.<sup id=\"cite_ref-80\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-80\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The artistic researcher works through theory-practice entanglements. This is to say, not by using practice as an illustration of theory or vice versa, but by exploring ways in which theory and practice are mutually implicated.<sup id=\"cite_ref-81\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-81\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Of course, art by its very nature is intelligent and cognitive: art practice aims to gain a better understanding of the world and to deliver new perspectives on reality. In this broad sense, for many centuries, beginning with Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance, research has been recognized as part of the work artists were doing. In our time, that is since the twentieth century, a large part of contemporary art production can, at least to some degree, be identified with critical (self-)reflection (as argued above). So, if research is a natural part of art practice, \u2018innate\u2019 to it, then why would we want to use the term \u2018research\u2019 at all when we speak about art? What does it add? Art in itself is not in need of the qualification of \u2018research\u2019. Artists are in no way required to demonstrate that they are doing research, neither are they required to account for or explicate what they are doing and how they are doing it.\n</p><p>In an academic context, artistic research has acquired a more specific, and perhaps more relevant, meaning. As a consequence of the so-called Bologna Agreements (1999),<sup id=\"cite_ref-82\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-82\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> entailing a Europe-wide reorganization of education which aimed at establishing a comparable BA and MA framework for all European countries, it became possible for artists and artistic \u2018makers\u2019 to obtain the PhD degree. Here, doing research means referring to making a particular research project that is made public <i>as research project</i>, including the artistic process that underlies it. In this context, certain criteria will have to be fulfilled. Such as the requirement that the researcher seeks the discussion in the public domain. The artists-as-researchers distinguish themselves from other artists by taking it upon themselves to gain a deeper understanding of the production of the work and the thinking process through a continuous dialogue with others. The artist-researchers allows others (peers, colleagues) to participate in their creative process, entering into a discussion with them and opening themselves up to critique. In this context, the public dimension of research in the sense of making the artistic process public and explicating the so-called \u2018tacit knowledge\u2019 embodied in the work and the practice, is at its core.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-78\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-78\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">I use \u2018art\u2019 here in an inclusive way, encompassing all artistic disciplines.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-79\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-79\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Generally, in the Anglo-Saxon countries the term \u2018practice-based\u2019 or \u2018practice-led\u2019 research is used.

However, a closer look shows that, as a matter of fact, destructive processes are at the core of capitalist culture. Drawing from Marx, economist Joseph Schumpeter suggests that capitalist economies are driven by what he calls the \u2018gale of creative destruction\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-87\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-87\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In order to generate new surplus value, the capitalist economic system requires a continuous process of destroying existing structures. This happens on a systemic level, as the continuous reshaping of economic orders, but also in immediate material confrontations of war, demolition, and wilful neglect. Demolishing old buildings and infrastructures is oftentimes promoted because it \u2018creates jobs\u2019 and the engineering of \u2018planned obsolescence\u2019 in commodities can be seen as the design of processes of auto-destruction.\n</p><p>In everyday life, the practices of destruction that constitute the \u2018back end\u2019 of liberal capitalism are covered up by an incessant stream of representations\u21b5 of the smooth, the shiny, and the new. The weapon trade fair may be the most radical manifestation of this dialectic. While the majority of commodities offered here are unambiguously conceived to enact material destruction, their modes of representation\u21b5 as a rule exceed the visual languages of consumerism in terms of the prominence of clean and spotless, slick material surfaces.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Productdestruction.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/f/f9/Productdestruction.jpg/300px-Productdestruction.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/f/f9/Productdestruction.jpg/450px-Productdestruction.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/f/f9/Productdestruction.jpg/600px-Productdestruction.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Productdestruction.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Industrial destruction of unused, 'off-spec' products at Northeast Data Destruction, Mansfield, MA.</div></div></div>\n<p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\nSchumpeter\u2019s \u2018gale of creative destruction\u2019 can be seen as part of a broader characteristic of capitalist expansionism. In <i>A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things</i>, Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore argue that capitalist enterprise is underpinned by a never-ending drive towards accessing ever cheaper resources in the form of nature, money, work, care, food, energy, and lives.<sup id=\"cite_ref-88\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-88\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In the context of this process of endless cheapening, \u2018creative destruction\u2019 operates as a catalyst for the system\u2019s incessant need for devaluation. As such, the destructive tendency that lies at the core of capitalist enterprise contributes to its character as essentially a \u2018frontier technology\u2019 that in its search for cheapness is in a very fundamental way irreconcilable with ambitions to establish a truly ecologically sustainable economic model.\n</p><p>There are also forms of destruction that exist beyond the logic of Schumpeter\u2019s \u2018gale of creative destruction\u2019. destruction caused by natural, non-human phenomena may nowadays occur as an indirect result of extractivist economic activity and will often quickly be subsumed in a process of commodification where ecological disaster serves as a cue for the development of new products, as is the case in e.g., the export of Dutch engineering systems to counter the threats of rising sea-levels in Jakarta, Indonesia.<sup id=\"cite_ref-89\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-89\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Nevertheless, these forms of destruction that are not directly anthropogenic also fall outside the sphere of human control and are posing fundamental systemic challenges. Climate-change induced natural destruction will drastically limit access to cheap resources on a global scale. At some point the final frontier in the ceaseless quest towards cheapness will be reached.\n</p><p>In addition to destruction caused by natural, non-human phenomena, there is also direct, human induced destruction that takes place outside\u2014and in opposition to\u2014the \u2018gale of creative destruction\u2019. Through acts of unmaking\u21b5, the mechanisms of capitalist production and consumption may be sabotaged to promote interests beyond mere cheapening and surplus value optimization.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-87\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-87\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">J.A.

The participants of the score contribute to each session with materials that engage their concepts, forms, and contents as performative contributions to collective learning. The [often unexpected] subjective positions emerging from these encounters are produced by the way proposals are materialized, addressed, and situated.\n</p><p>Who\u2019s talking through them, who are they talking to, and what kind of entanglements are they proposing?\n</p><p>The score can be seen as a generative infrastructure that invites to participate as fellow researchers in each other\u2019s practice. It is a form of engaged spectatorship based on responsiveness and response-ability (K. Barad) which allows to think through the relations and attachments suggested in each participant\u2019s proposal.<br />\n<br />\nBecause it is a formalist tool, the score works as a perverse partner that regulates mutual relations and modes of presence through chance procedures, enabling connections that otherwise would maybe not be experienced. It is useful to think of the score as a self-regulating infrastructure operating through people\u2019s practices and contents. This practice asks for attendance in a state of shared alertness for the individual and collective assemblages, entanglements and situatednesses that the research practices of the participants propose. The paradox between the formal precision of the score and the unpredictability of the materials that are produced, allows for the experience of aesthetic and ethical readings that reconsider and reposition oneself as part of world(s).\n</p><p>In trying to deal with questions related to co-learning that aim to encompass dissensus, not knowing, methodological understanding, authorship, politics, backgrounds, histories, criticality\u21b5, sociability, institutional framework, philosophy, ecologies, and material practice (a lot!), the scores\u21b5 can enable a platform for exchange through critical making\u21b5.\n</p><p>What we can learn from engaging with each other in such a way, is that form and content are always already symptomatic of a set of relations, and that these sets of relations propose degrees of inclusiveness, contradictions, and resistance. The venture of this kind of proposition is to support articulation of artistic practices as fundamentally relational, embedded and potentially critical to forms of governance (because it is itself of form of governance that makes participants aware of the arbitrary character of rules). The subjectivities that become manifest in the scoring\u21b5 practice can be seen as organisms who gain sustainability and stability through their interplay and gradually improving cohabitation. Score, in this way, becomes a constructed framework through which an ecology of practices (Isabelle Stengers) is manifested, each of them revealing their support structure and proliferating within the alliances, conflicts, and proximities they evoke.\n</p><p>These encounters propose a form of sociability, by their regular character over a period of time, but most of all by virtue of the subjectivities that emerge out of them. The type of engagement at stake is one that I can name as friendship (see artificial friendship\u21b5): curiosity, presence, offering of time, attention, staying with, consideration, but also dissensus, opposition and criticality\u21b5 as a form of care.\n</p><p>The question these scores\u21b5 address and that I\u2019m eager to expand and discuss would be how to develop infrastructures that frame, without polarizing or stigmatizing, knowledge production; how to think infrastructures of encounter that propose ways of \u2018reading\u2019 and \u2018writing\u2019, \u2018re-reading\u2019 and \u2018re-writing\u2019 through each other\u2019s practice, as a methodology for understanding and crafting differences that matter outside of specialization or a discipline. What kinds of institutional support structures can be developed to sustain and empower the transformation and re-actualization of the values attached to artistic practice, and how to value them as matters of concern?

Tellingly, the project was subtitled: \u2018in ten years\u2019. Yet this did not concern a blueprint for a manageable plan with concrete steps to be taken. Rather, the participants were asked to think of possibilities existing in the present and how to hypothetically realize them\u2014at a certain moment in time, and within a time span of ten years. Each contribution focuses on an imaginary year, consequently, in which, for instance, schools host living animals and take them up in the curriculum; supermarkets no longer sell meat; municipal councils give one third of their seats to representatives of different groups of animals (zo\u00f6p\u21b5). Thus, the idea was not just to imagine alternatives but to emphasize that these possibilities are already here, and could as well be realized now.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2._the_principle_of_hope_made_real\">2. the principle of hope made real</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_not-yet&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-3\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_not-yet&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The very phrase \u2018the not-yet\u2019 was coined by Ernst Bloch in an extensive study called <i>The Principle of Hope</i>, written between 1938 and 1947. Instead of resorting to the humanist origin of the term utopia as a product of the imagination, Bloch argued that throughout history, utopias have been everywhere, as materializations of hope that do not depend on an imagined alternative or a promise but on something to be <i>done</i> in the here and now. In contrast, the Enlightenment utopian/dystopian complex with figures such as the Marquis de Condorcet, depended on a historiography that depicts the process of mankind as progress, as a matter of growing complexity and improvement. The utopian future can be predicted and made top-down, not just as a matter of imagining a better or more beautiful world, but of managing a reality in terms of the probability to get there. The nineteenth century would come to witness what this meant, in the areas of urban planning and landscape design. This, however, paled in comparison to how in the twentieth century entire environments were imagined and built from scratch, and agro-industries and biotechnologies would start to reconfigure the entire idea of life\u2014of all life.\n</p><p>In the project <i>The</i> <i>Meat Free City</i>, the hope for an alternative future found an anchor point in a collective process. This made the concept of hope materially real, through a mode of working together in commitment and solidarity. The project started in May 2020, smack in the middle of the Covid isolation, and would result in a publication of a Dutch book plus a digital version in English, in the spring of 2021. When publishers proved to be reluctant to bring out the book, or demanded the right to considerably alter its form and contents, the collective decided to raise money themselves, thus involving even more people but also safeguarding the artistic concept and process. The hope and reality of making this art piece in practice thus came to resonate with the hope and reality of an alternative future.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"3._the_not-yet_as_a_commitment_to_the_present\">3. the not-yet as a commitment to the present</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_not-yet&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-4\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_not-yet&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-4\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>When the Meat Free City collective accepted its task of making a work of art that would manifest an alternative reality, they decided to focus on the existing present. Obviously, this did not imply that they accepted everything the present had to offer. In fact, some of the contributors found out that the meat industry was even more abysmal than they had previously thought. For all participants, the project consisted of a collective pedagogical endeavour: a process of learning together, sharing knowledge, and considering different forms of imagining futures that would do justice to both the present and the future.\n</p><p>In this light, Donna Haraway\u2019s <i>A Cyborg Manifesto</i> from 1985 still holds its force. In this manifesto, Haraway proposed an alternative future. The distinction between manifesto and utopia is pivotal here, in terms of function, style, and aim. The manifesto provoked its readers not so much to think of possible futures but to conceive of a better future as a possibility in the present. Like Marx and Engels, Haraway insisted \u2018that possibilities for better worlds are born inside not outside the present relations of domination\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-93\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-93\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> This is why the potential of a collective that Haraway provocatively located in the cyborg is \u2018fully implicated in the world\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-94\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-94\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Or, again, instead of fleeing towards the future on the basis of a fictive blueprint, real improvement is only possible if people consciously \u2018inhabit the despised place\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-95\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-95\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Or, it is within an existing mode of production where the potential for a better world lingers, not as an ideal but within the material givens of that very world, and in the nigh inexhaustible potential embodied in life as <i>zo\u00eb</i> (zo\u00f6p\u21b5 and zo\u00f6nomy\u21b5).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"4._conditions_of_change:_interruption_or_arranging_coincidence\">4. conditions of change: interruption or arranging coincidence</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_not-yet&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-5\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=The_not-yet&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In recent years, a popular term in artistic circles was \u2018intervention\u2019. The term means, literally, that artists \u2018come in-between\u2019, perhaps in order to change a given situation. With the not-yet, however, the focus on both the collective process and the commitment to the present implies that intervention is only viable when artists do not already know what needs to be changed, but intervene to make change possible. Another term introduced in this context is \u2018interruption\u2019, a term that is of special relevance in the context of a capitalist system that can only function on the basis of constant movement; a movement that also blocks the emergence of alternatives. With respect to this, artist Jeanne van Heeswijk, in cooperation with BAK-Utrecht, shifted the emphasis from \u2018emergency\u2019 to \u2018the emergent\u2019 in the project \u2018Trainings for the Not-yet\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-96\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-96\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> \u2018The emergent\u2019 aimed to underscore the possibilities in the now, or the potential in the present, but also emphasized that the situation must be such that something can indeed emerge. The question then becomes what kinds of practices can make things emerge or coincide, in a process that time and time again asks participants to sense the implications of their practices or what the consequences of their actions may be. This is why the title of the project did not have \u2018training\u2019 in the title but \u2018trainings\u2019: practices. In this context, strategy has to give in to tactics.

This then forms the basis for critical reflection on creativity, production, and consumption (see criticality\u21b5). If the aim of this critical engagement is to formulate alternatives to the mechanisms and cultural habits of endless accumulation and expansion\u2014the backbone of economic liberalism\u2014we must also consider material processes that take place beyond or in opposition to the making of new artefacts and look towards processes of deterioration and acts of destruction\u21b5. In this, it is important to distinguish between the processes of destruction\u21b5 that are inherent in capitalist expansionism (see destruction\u21b5) and those that destabilize or challenge the systemic status quo. The latter can be designated as acts of unmaking.\n</p><p>The study and exploration of these \u2018outcast\u2019 processes and the ways in which\u2014and reasons why\u2014 they are excluded from dominant narratives in consumer culture could inform perspectives that challenge the myth of endless growth.\n</p><p>unmaking may involve breaking technological devices, such as the Luddites\u2019 attacks on textile machinery in the early nineteenth century, but it can also concern the creation of technological devices in order to destroy (part of) the domain of production and consumption. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are an example of this. Such acts and technologies of unmaking are commonly dismissed as nihilistic violence aimed at the supposedly peaceful everyday of consumer culture. However, considering that destruction\u21b5 is actually an essential component of the very logic of capitalism\u2014albeit often hidden below its shiny surfaces\u2014processes of unmaking should rather be examined as transgressions of the inherent destructive violence of the \u2018business\u21b5 as usual\u2019 of production and consumption.\n</p><p>Practices of unmaking can be read in the context of Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\u2019s analysis of the relationship between subjective and objective forms of violence:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2026subjective violence is experienced as such against the background of a non-violent zero level. It is seen as a perturbation of the \u2018normal\u2019, peaceful state of things. However, objective violence is precisely the violence inherent in this \u2018normal\u2019 state of things.<sup id=\"cite_ref-97\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-97\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Acts of unmaking form an explicit response to the often-overlooked objective violence of destruction\u21b5-based economic activity.\n</p><p>As such, unmaking can be experienced as subjective violence from the perspective of regular consumers. However, it should rather be read as a form of unmasking, a pulling away of the shiny surface of consumer culture to bring the inherent violence to light. But in fact, what is indicated with \u2018unmaking\u2019 here, is more than what is captured by the notion of unmasking. It is an affirmative escape from both the opaque glitz of consumer surfaces as well as from the extractivist (i.e., extracting natural resources from the Earth) business-as-usual of the larger capitalist machine. Unmaking is to be understood as a combined material, creative and symbolic negation breaking matter away from its looming capitalist burden and making it available for other meanings, other appropriations, other play.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-97\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-97\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, <i>Violence: Six Sideways Reflections</i> (London: Profile Books, 2008), p. 2.</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:LEA_front.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"LEA front.JPG\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/4/42/LEA_front.JPG/300px-LEA_front.JPG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/4/42/LEA_front.JPG/450px-LEA_front.JPG 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/4/42/LEA_front.JPG/600px-LEA_front.JPG 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:LEA_front.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:LEA_shaver.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/d4/LEA_shaver.jpg/300px-LEA_shaver.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/d4/LEA_shaver.jpg/450px-LEA_shaver.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/d4/LEA_shaver.jpg/600px-LEA_shaver.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:LEA_shaver.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Dani Ploeger - Laboratory of Electronic Ageing, 2019.

There is a clarity of transaction in that publications from our distro may be purchased, and points A and B are designated by where the book begins (most often from our relay centre in Hong Kong, but sometimes also directly from the publisher) and where the reader-receiver is located. But in and around that there is a narrative arc that makes space for all kinds of action and relation to occur, if one pays enough attention. Couriering becomes a physical linkage imbued with other potentiality, because the courier is very often a reader or bookmaker herself, or becomes one. In this sense, our enterprise feels more akin to the challenge of Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s \u2018Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction\u2019\u2014a strange realism composed of the banal details of moving things from one place to another, begging other possibilities for the ways we inscribe the world.</i>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u2018Getting a Move On: A Logistics of Thought towards Print and Publics\u2019, Elaine W.

(\u2018Erratic Art Mail International System\u2019) from 1977? It was preceded by an essay \u2018Mail Art and the Big Monster\u2019 in which he wrote:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>Mail art uses as support the postal system\u2014a complex, international system of transport, including thousands of people, buildings, machinery, world treaties, and God knows what. The proof that the post is not the medium is that to use it, an artist doesn\u2019t need to understand how it functions. Even in the utopic possibility that the artist reaches complete understanding of the system, he cannot control it. \u2026 All I know is that there is a Monster, and that by posting all sorts of mail pieces, I am knocking at his door.</i>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>To quote from the EAMIS manifesto:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>An alternative to the official Post Offices.\n</p><p>1. The E.A.M.I.S will carry messages in any format: cards, letters, parcels, etc, and realized in any medium\u2014book, cassette, tape, film, etc.<i></i>\n</p><p>2. The message must reach the E.A.M.I.S office by any way other than the official Post Offices. It can be delivered by the author or by any other person. \u2026\n</p><p>8. By using the E.A.M.I.S you support the only alternative to the national bureaucracies and you strengthen the international artists community.\n</p><p><i>Ulises Carri\u00f3n (Post Master)</i>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Florian\n</p><p><br />\n2020-11-14\n</p><p>Dear Florian,\n</p><p>Yes, I found it poignant that at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in the West there was a sudden interest in one-on-one correspondences again\u2014even e-mail chain letters started to resurface in my inbox. Of course, with the diminishing of face-to-face contact the opening of other channels by which intimacy and affect can travel makes perfect sense. The LIGHT LOGISTICS project of Display Distribute is viewed in mainland China and Hong Kong much more through this social lens than as the larger inquiry into infrastructure that we discuss ourselves. At least from my own point of view as a courier, these are the kinds of comments we hear most from receivers and other participating couriers, because the real-life interactions logisticking garners are completely different encounters than would happen otherwise with the commercial courier companies that everyone has now grown accustomed to in their daily lives. We find out we have friends in common, we tell one another our travel plans, there are publishing projects and even the sharing of pet photos among strangers. Maybe it\u2019s a bit mundane or trite, but the also banal question of slowness that is intertwined with these interactions and journeys is one of the most important aspects of reconsidering how globalization, technology, and infrastructure affects our relations to the world and with one another.\n</p><p>Best,\n</p><p>e\n</p><p><br />\n2020-11-11\n</p><p>Dear Elaine,\n</p><p>My friend Goodiepal (musician, one-of-a-kind-person, and community activist living in Copenhagen) runs a similar courier system where people send postal mail to his mother or grandmother [<i>he doesn\u2019t have an e-mail address</i>]/Friends pick it up and physically deliver it to him wherever in the world he is. His collective (Goodiepal &amp; Pals) now also runs a courier/smuggling operation to bring refugees over the EU border in Serbia. \n</p><p>-F\n</p><p><br />\n2020-11-10\n</p><p>Dear Florian,\n</p><p>Goodiepal, yes! It sounds like his European underground railroad is a heroic form of subterfuge from which we could learn more and exchange with. It has also always been our main reference to think through smugglers and pirates and parallel traders. With the fragile relations between Hong Kong and the mainland being the very first impetus, the transition toward focusing upon publications being carried across borders has very much to do with the sensitivity of content and those risks involved. As an aside, I like very much the use of the word \u2018sensitivity\u2019 when discussing the sociopolitical \u2018appropriateness\u2019 of content in the Chinese context. Other countries get a good laugh about China announcing more than often enough about its \u2018feelings\u2019 being hurt by other countries, but what is acute about this notion is that it does not remove the realm of aesthetics and the affective from politics as most nation states pretend to do in the name of a general welfare. Regardless, for us to slip the most personal and/or minute of encounters into a structure that does not need them could perhaps be described as a soft call to sensitize, weaken, or slow down the slick and steely frames that infrastructure and contemporary logistics\u21b5 advance.\n</p><p>Today I had an interesting conversation with members of the Laboratory of Insurrectionary Imagination and a few others, and JJ recalled how when they were doing interventions in the finance district of New York\u2014I think in the early 2000s\u2014wanting to learn all about finance as a means towards dismantling capitalism. But later, they grew to think that you don\u2019t need to understand the system if you really want to smash it, because dismantling goes beyond reform; the real goal would be to build up something completely other...\n</p><p>I don\u2019t necessarily agree with this thought, though the degree of how much one should understand what one wants to infiltrate, rework, dismantle, and so on, needs to be addressed. It is notable, nevertheless, that Carri\u00f3n also premises the ignorance of the artist as part of his manifest.\n</p><p>There was a period in my logistics\u21b5 fervour where I wanted to take online courses in industrial logistics\u21b5 in order to understand the frameworks better, but perhaps intuitively the scale didn\u2019t reach me down here in the shadowy realm of one-to-one exchanges... I have, however, investigatively engaged in some cross-border parallel trading of luxury cosmetics and milk powder!\n</p><p>Greetings from Guangzhou,\n</p><p>e\n</p><p><br />\n2020-11-18\n</p><p>While reading your text \u2018Getting a Move On: A Logistics of Thought towards Print and Publics\u2019, I was reminded of a discussion on piracy with Raqs Media Collective circa fifteen years ago that taught me about my (and generally Western) biases in perspectives on piracy. Back then, piracy was largely discussed in the context of download culture (with The Pirate Bay, Library.nu/LibGen, aaaaarg &amp; WaReZ servers as the standard examples), but Raqs brought in the perspective of pirated software and DVDs sold on street markets. (I wonder whether that culture and economy still exist. When I moved to my neighbourhood in Rotterdam, it was still normal that when you went to a hairdresser, mobile vendors of pirated DVDs would come by and sell you the latest Hollywood films<i>.</i>) Back then, I largely shared the view of the Free Software/Open Source movement that intellectual property should end but that the piracy of commercial software ultimately had the effect of keeping the software industry in business\u21b5\u2014preventing a mainstream success of Free Software. Raqs, however, argued in favour of considering pirate work as a form of community care addressing real community needs, which then made me rethink my position. Nevertheless, I\u2019m still torn on this issue. If one just sticks to the example of digital piracy, then one could argue that The Pirate Bay paved the way for Netflix, LibGen paved the way for Amazon Kindle, and WaReZ servers paved the way for App Stores; not only conceptually or in their user interface design, but also in the \u2018content\u2019 they provided. (The Pirate Bay offered pretty much the same kind of mainstream films that are offered by Netflix, and so on).\n</p><p>-F\n</p><p><br />\nE: There is a great text from Lawrence Liang (also a frequent collaborator with Raqs), Prashant Iyengar and Jiti Nichani called \u2018<i>How Does an Asian Commons Mean\u2019</i>, and it offers exactly a varying genealogy from which to historically and culturally understand piracy and versioning as a process of commoning. It was written some years ago and maybe also does not resolve the quandary you mention regarding how digital piracy and FLOSS (Free Libre and Open Source Software) movements have provided fodder for the strengthened barricades of corporate platforms\u21b5, but this cat-and-mouse game was always the case, wasn\u2019t it?\n</p><p>F: In my view, Open Source and piracy activists are still far ahead of contemporary art institutions in their rejection of property and alternative visions of ownership and public distribution. But I also tend to find those debates in FLOSS, piracy and associated art practices being stuck in discourses of the 1990s. They tend to get deadlocked in technicalities of media, and in debates on how to keep channels open. Therefore, I am very much in tune with Display Distribute and how it has shifted all these questions to: \u2018who will transport it?\u2019 and \u2018who will read it?\u2019\n</p><p>[correspondence continued in Collective Organization\u21b5]\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"feeding\">feeding</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Feeding&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Feeding&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Thalia Hoffman</span>\n</p><p>To eat is a basic need for living. However, it is much more than merely a physical need. feeding and eating have always been part of socio-political, economic, and cultural frames of thinking and of decision-making. The priorities of these frames, or belief systems, decide upon our eating habits, such as religious food traditions and regulations, the distribution of nutrition supplies around the globe or determine certain foods as expensive or cheap. feeding and eating also play a major role in the construction of subjective identities. Personal selections of certain ingredients, specific cooking methods and ceremonial eating habits tend to characterize human beings, individually as well as socially.

In agreeing to eat something, the eater accepts something foreign to become part of his/her body. \u2018The classification of something as food means it is understood as something made to become part of who we are.\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-101\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-101\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> According to philosopher Deane Curtin, humans have a physical understanding that anything they eat will become part of their bodily self. As such, according to Curtin, food holds a special relation to the Self. In the performance series <i>To Serve You</i> I, as the main feeder, draw attention to this physical understanding, while participants are challenged to respond and to interact with what might be transferred into their body and become part of them.\n</p><p>feeding inherently contains power relations between the one who feeds and the one who eats. The power relations can be found within personal relationships, as well as between humans and institutions\u21b5, and people amid their socio-political community. Surprisingly these power relations are neither clear nor stable and tend to change throughout various feeding interactions. <i>To Serve You</i> seeks to explore the connection between food, rules, law, nationality, and security through the power relations between guest/host, feeder/eater and among the diners.\n</p><p>In a century in which everyday life is flooded with images, moving images and sounds, I choose to infiltrate all of the bodily senses, so that my practice can be experienced through the body as well as inside the body. To me this is especially urgent, since the local socio-political conflicts of the area east to the Mediterranean, where I live, are vigorously interpreted, visually and vocally. Between news, TV-shows, films, blogs, and academic research in various fields, endless information has been and is being communicated, documented, and recorded regarding the conflicts in this area. I experiment with senses and inner parts in order to explore the possibilities of embodying socio-political critical thinking and making\u21b5. These experiences are a result of both dissatisfaction with communicating only through sight and sound, and of my eagerness to subversively interact and affect participants through my practice.\n</p><p><br />\nto serve you\u2014a performance series (2017\u2013ongoing)\n</p><p>The first realization of the performance series was part of the exhibition \u2018Motions for the Agenda\u2019 (curated by Avi Feldman in collaboration with Vardit Gross, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.artport.art/exhibition/motions-for-the-agenda/?lang=en\"><u>Artport</u></a> 2017). First as a series of dinners with jurists, culture scholars, sociologists, and psychologists in which we talked about feeding while being fed by me, held at The Israeli Center for Digital Art in Holon. These dinners were recorded, then edited and mixed into a sound work. The next step, inspired by the sound work, was an intimate dinner performance of a seven-course vegetarian meal performed by three feeders to an audience of six eaters.\n</p><p>Since then, <i>To Serve You</i> performs in different venues, it continuously adjusts itself to the changing socio-political and environmental surroundings alongside the performance location and the number of eaters and feeders.\n</p><p>Performers: Michal Samama, Carmel Bar, Ofri Omer, Thalia Hoffman.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-98\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-98\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">I use the term tactic following Michael de Certeau\u2019s use of the term in practices of everyday life.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-99\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-99\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Michael de Certeau, Frederic Jameson and Carl R.

This makes it a fundamentally collective material practice\u21b5. Additionally, all writing can be reproduced, transported, adapted, rewritten, repurposed, reshaped, and shared with comparatively little effort and cost. Therefore, writing arguably is one of the most collective material practices\u21b5 in existence.\n</p><p>With the introduction of variable fonts by Adobe, Apple, Google, and Microsoft in September 2016, the stage was set for grammatographic writing, whereby letters are dynamic instead of static. In variable fonts, letter outlines no longer have a static contour, but can be modified by the writer into different shapes according to parameters predefined by the designer. For example, a letter no longer needs to be written in predefined weights such as normal or bold type (as is the case with static fonts), but can now be written in any of the intermediary shapes between normal and bold. Also, dynamic fonts or \u2018grammata\u2019 can provide more advanced capabilities whereby letters can be transformed into completely different shapes, defined by the person writing with them. Currently, we can understand this innovation and its potential for transforming cultures of writing only through old concepts and conventions\u2014namely traditional, static-outline fonts and typography. In order to grasp its future potential, we propose a new term: grammatography: writing with prefabricated dynamic letters. These can change their shape during and even after the act of writing.\n</p><p>The term grammatography explicitly contrasts this new method of writing with the ones we are currently using: chirography and typography. When writing by hand, also known as chirography, writers generate the letters themselves while writing text, in contrast to typography where writers use pre-fabricated letters (nearly always designed by another person) to compose their own words, sentences, and texts. Typography enables distribution of texts in large editions, whereby each copy is 100% identical and whose letters remain the same forever (if one leaves aside the material wear of ink and paper). 500 years after the famous Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible or just B42) was printed, this is still the most common way of sharing information and communicating in writing.\n</p><p>While Gutenberg was definitely not the first person to use prefabricated letters, he was arguably most influential for the chirographic to typographic transformation of the Western world. Many have written and published about the societal impact of the Gutenberg press, for example Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Vil\u00e9m Flusser, and Eric A. Havelock. While Flusser is known for his claim that (human) history only started with the act of writing, it is perhaps even more important to recognize to which extent human life is informed by how we write. Up to now, Western modernity has been clearly a typographic one, if only due to the fact that all laws are published in static typographic writing.\n</p><p>But with the introduction of variable fonts, grammatography has become widely available and promises to disrupt this foundational technology undergirding modernity.\n</p><p>There is a clear connection between grammatography and the internet, or more precisely, the technologies that constitute the World Wide Web: the hypertext transfer protocol (http) in conjunction with the hypertext markup language (html) and its extensions CSS and Javascript. This combination of network protocol, file format and, optionally, computer programming language augment linear text into hypertext. However, this technology still only makes the structure of a text dynamic, not the shape of its letters.\n</p><p>In the early days of the internet, most people only understood hypertext as a variation of the static text, and therefore borrowed typographic terminology such as headers, footers, and pages from the foregoing typographic age. Vil\u00e9m Flusser, however, immediately understood the novelty and consequence of this new technology. When he published a hypertext version of his book <i>Die Schrift</i> in 1987, he wisely and presciently called this publication neither an e-book nor an electronic publication, but simply a \u2018Nicht Mehr Buch\u2019 (\u2018no longer book\u2019).\n</p><p>Along the same lines, we could ask whether a letter whose shape can be dynamically changed is still a letter, or whether it is rather a no-longer-letter. Can writing with dynamic letters even be compared with the writing of static letters, or writing by hand?\n</p><p>grammatography has to do with letters, to the degree that both the writer of the text and the designer of the letters are involved in defining the letter shapes. As such, grammatography could be understood as a new form of writing in addition to our existing forms of writing, an act in which we use new sorts-of-writing instruments, in the same way as we play different musical instruments. The result is an interplay of the performer and instrument builders. Both instruments are characterized by flexible, built-in general vocabularies that are subsequently performed; in music, musical scales like the chromatic scale, in text, script likes Latin script.\n</p><p>grammatography can open up as many possibilities for writing as musical instruments can for making sound. While we primarily play musical instruments for aesthetic reasons (expressions of feelings instead of communicating precise messages), a similar expressive range could (re)emerge in this new kind of writing. grammatography points to a form of writing that transcends the currently dominant typographic logic of writing, and frees the act of writing from its typographic imprisonment.\n</p><p>A historical note: the term grammatography was first used in 1605, in a publication in which the Dutch calligrapher Cornelis Dirckszoon Boissens demonstrated his penmanship. Its full title is <i>Grammato-Graphices. In Quo Varia Scripturae Emblemata</i> (\u2018Grammato-Graphices. Containing Various Illustrations of Handwriting\u2019). In 1861, grammatography was also used in the English translation of the German publication <i>Alphabete orientalischer und occidentalischer Sprachen</i>: <i>Grammatography: a Manual of Reference to the Alphabets of Ancient and Modern Languages</i>. Why the translator chose this term is unknown. Finally, the word grammatography appears in <i>De la grammatologie</i>, by Jacques Derrida (1967). Here, the term is used as a synonym for calligraphy. Finally in 2019, the Dutch type foundry Underware proposed to use this term for every kind of writing that involves dynamic letters. This proposal was made in response to the technical invention of variable fonts.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/b/b8/Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg/300px-Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/b/b8/Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg/450px-Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/b/b8/Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg/600px-Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grammatography-Lee-Ufan-From-Line-1978-lexicon.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grammatography-lexicon.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Grammatography-lexicon.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/c/c0/Grammatography-lexicon.jpg/300px-Grammatography-lexicon.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"234\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/c/c0/Grammatography-lexicon.jpg/450px-Grammatography-lexicon.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/c/c0/Grammatography-lexicon.jpg/600px-Grammatography-lexicon.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grammatography-lexicon.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/4/48/Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg/300px-Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/4/48/Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg/450px-Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/4/48/Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg/600px-Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grammatography-lexicon2.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>[[File: |thumb]]\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grammatography-Penstrument.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/7/7f/Grammatography-Penstrument.jpg/300px-Grammatography-Penstrument.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/7/7f/Grammatography-Penstrument.jpg/450px-Grammatography-Penstrument.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/7/7f/Grammatography-Penstrument.jpg/600px-Grammatography-Penstrument.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grammatography-Penstrument.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

A festival will take place on the cusp of water and land, and the artists are preparing site-specific installations. As they present their projects to each other, one of them claims to be based in the particular area and persistently invites the artists calling in from remote locations to \u2018come over for a boat trip, and stick their boots in the mud\u2019. There is no doubt that the best way to get to grips with the shifting grounds of the festival location will be to step on site.\n</p><p>Physical presence, and direct contact with the specific muddiness of a terrain can be part of a situated knowledge practice, a powerful antidote to presumed positions of exteriority and views from nowhere. But it is also a proprietary gesture that essentializes territorial nearness. It counts on the privilege of individual experience, and relies on touch at first hand or boot, sticking to knowledge that can only be acquired by presence. Centring on what can be perceived from where one is standing is taking a risk to foreground what is here and now, and to negate interdependencies that operate at a distance.

New Materialist modes of thinking are largely accountable for this change in perspective on the role of practice in academic research. In the humanities, \u2018practice\u2019 has long been, and often still is, regarded as subordinate and subservient to theory. Many scholars look down on practice as being merely the handwork in the laboratory that is needed to support or provide proof of theory. The truly important work is of a theoretical nature, that is, the work of the mind. The hegemony of theory largely explains the struggle of art academies in Europe to gain recognition for artistic research\u21b5 by universities (see: artistic research\u21b5).\n</p><p>From a historical point of view, the binary understanding of concept and matter, of subject and object, and the hierarchy of theory over practice in Western culture originated in the age-old tradition of valuing <i>vita contemplativa</i> over <i>vita activa.</i> The predominance of mind over body can be traced back to Plato and to Saint Augustine\u2019s embracing of platonic thinking, as argued by Hannah Arendt in <i>The Life of the Mind</i> (1978). Like Plato, Aristotle held deductive thinking in high esteem and downplayed experiment. Aristotle\u2019s <i>Categories</i> became formative of and canonical to medieval scholasticism.\n</p><p>According to American philosopher Ian Hacking (<i>Representing and Intervening</i>, 1983), the imbalance of theory and experiment was reversed with the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century, in particular with the thinking of Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626). During the scientific revolution, practical experiment \u2018was officially declared to be the royal road to knowledge, and the schoolmen were scorned because they argued from books instead of observing the world around them\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-106\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-106\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> But times have changed, Hacking tells us, and today the history of the sciences is almost always written as a history of theory rather than of experiment: philosophers of science \u2018constantly discuss theories and representations\u21b5 of reality, but say almost nothing about experiment, technology, or the use of knowledge to alter the world\u2019. Hacking also notes that the theory/experiment status difference is \u2018modelled on social rank\u2019. His <i>Representing and Intervening</i> contests the theory-dominated history of science. It is Hacking\u2019s conviction that \u2018a question posed in terms of theory and experiment is misleading because it treats theory as one rather uniform kind of thing and experiment as another\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-107\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-107\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>For Hacking, practice is characterized by experiment and by the intervention in reality (instead of the representation\u21b5 of reality). Hacking calls himself an \u2018ontological realist\u2019 who believes the entities, states and processes described by correct theories are real, and not mere \u2018constructs of the human mind for organizing our experiments\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-108\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-108\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In a certain respect, Hacking\u2019s <i>Representing and Intervening</i> anticipates New Materialist modes of thinking.<sup id=\"cite_ref-109\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-109\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Under the heading of New Materialism, a diverse group of thinkers is brought together who, despite differences in outlook, agree in one fundamental respect: the existence of a reality, or of a world, of objects <i>out there</i>, independent of our gaze and of our knowledge of them, independent also of our access to these objects. These thinkers aim \u2018to preserve the autonomy and irreducibility of substance\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-110\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-110\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> New Materialism embodies the attempt to sidestep the subject-object divide created by Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Enlightenment philosophers such as Hume and Kant. New Materialists aim to overcome the Cartesian worldview, that is, the subject-object distinction.\n</p><p>A leading proponent of the New Materialist strain of thinking is the American philosopher and physicist Karen Barad\u2014even though she does not like to use the term New Materialism, preferring \u2018agential realism\u2019 in its stead. Agential realism is the attempt \u2018to rethink fundamental concepts that support binary thinking including the notions of matter, discourse, causality, agency, power, identity, embodiment, objectivity, space, and time.\u2019<sup id=\"cite_ref-111\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-111\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Barad emphasizes that\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>agential realism does not merely offer a new framework through which to understand the roles of the human <i>and</i> the nonhuman, the material <i>and</i> the discursive, but inquires into the very <i>practices</i> through which they are differentiated.<sup id=\"cite_ref-112\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-112\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is not the scope of this text to offer an interpretation of Barad\u2019s thinking. What is important here is that Barad does not refer to matter as a fixed substance, but rather as a process of \u2018iterative intra-activity\u2019. \u2018Matter\u2019, in her view, \u2018refers to phenomena in their ongoing materialization\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-113\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-113\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Now, how might this New Materialist account relate to what is generally understood as material practice in the discourse among artists? It must be noted that in artistic discourse material practice is not used in opposition to \u2018conceptual practice\u2019. Put otherwise, in artistic discourse, a practice that takes physical material or materiality as point of departure is not necessarily opposed to a practice that is guided by an abstract idea. For artists, material practice and \u2018conceptual practice\u2019 are multi-layered terms that do not exclude one another. More than that, from the 1960s onward, conceptual artists sought to connect or entangle matter and idea, image and language, thematizing this connection through their work.<sup id=\"cite_ref-114\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-114\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Conceptual art practices therefore may be, and often are, rooted in materiality and in material processes. This is the reason why many so-called Conceptual artists (such as Lawrence Weiner) refuse to be categorized as such. \u2018Conceptual\u2019 here refers not so much to the \u2018art work as idea\u2019 but to art practices in which the process of art making is regarded as equally important or relevant as the eventual outcome of this process (Cf Weiner: \u2018the piece need not be built\u2019)<sup id=\"cite_ref-115\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-115\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>. There is no hierarchy here of \u2018materiality\u2019 and \u2018conceptuality\u2019, and no hierarchy of theory and experiment. In conceptual art (not only referring to American Conceptual Art form the 1960s and 1970s, but in the broader sense of the word), the role and importance of critical reflection in the making process, and of theory in the physical experiment, is acknowledged. One might even argue that nowadays, under the \u2018postconceptual condition\u2019 (Peter Osborne), the conceptual nature of art practice is recognized as a <i>sine qua non</i>. Art practice is of a material as well as a conceptual nature at the same time. One might conclude that the traditional philosophical opposition of matter and concept, of practice and theory, is overcome or nullified here.\n</p><p>Examples in this book of the reciprocal entanglement of concept and matter are Femke Snelting\u2019s project at the Bidston Observatory in Liverpool (see Snelting on embeddednes\u21b5); Thalia Hoffman\u2019s performance <i>To Serve You</i> (in feeding\u21b5); or Kate Rich on business\u21b5 (in fact, this book contains many more examples).\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-106\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-106\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ian Hacking, <i>Representing and Intervening Introductory Topics in the Philosophy of Natural Science</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), p. 149.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-107\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-107\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ibid., p. 162.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-108\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-108\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Ibid., p. 2.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-109\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-109\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">The New Materialist strain of thinking goes by a number of different names, among which New Materialism, Object Oriented Ontology, and Speculative Realism.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-110\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-110\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Levi R.

Along with agriculture, the production of roof tiles and bricks had been the main economic activity in the region, up until the early 2000s. When Jatiwangi art Factory (JaF) was founded in 2005, the roof tile industry was declining. The declining number of traditional brick factories was occurring alongside state development projects to advance Jatiwangi as a large manufacturing region, in response to larger free market demands. Slowly but surely, the <i>tanah</i> of Jatiwangi that was characteristic of the ingenious hands of the people\u2014a solid identity of Jatiwangi\u2014shifted its role to a land of new concrete factories. Most of the agricultural land was changed from productive food cultivation into land for housing, shopping, and many other infrastructures that come with urban development and growth.\n</p><p>Arief Yudi, co-founder of JaF, often asks guests, colleagues, and friends, \u2018What do you think an ideal city should be like?\u2019 This question, a strange one for cosmopolites who have no attachment to a single domain or territory, quietly problematizes the question of what is \u2018ideal\u2019. It is a pivotal question for those who were born, live, work, and will die in the same place, here in Jatiwangi. Issues revolving around dignity, identity, and a way of life in the space we occupy in the present and future is at stake. This is firmly intertwined with JaF\u2019s artistic practices and even its very existence.\n</p><p>There is no other choice for the people of Jatiwangi but to defend their <i>tanah</i>\u2014their land, their earth, their soil, their ground\u2014that has provided for life and its own ecosystem for decades. Many collective methods, work forms, performative acts, understandings, and artistic practices have made <i>tanah</i> their centre as well as their subject. In these processes, <i>tanah</i> is being shaped, positioned, redefined, redignified, and its status restored. By defending <i>tanah</i>, the people of Jatiwangi prevail as a collective subject that remains whole in the face of state development projects that neglect the voices of this community. Up to this day, JaF\u2019s practices and efforts are still expanding. One of them is Kota Terakota (Terracotta City), the result of <i>saling bantu</i> (<b>mutual assistance</b>) between various parties and policy makers.\n</p><p><span class=\"page-break\">&#160;</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Slide2-aa.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e4/Slide2-aa.jpg/300px-Slide2-aa.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e4/Slide2-aa.jpg/450px-Slide2-aa.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e4/Slide2-aa.jpg/600px-Slide2-aa.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Slide2-aa.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Re-applied to art, this means, to quote David Teh\u2019s characterization of ruangrupa, to further \u2018autonomy of artists, singular or plural, but not necessarily that of the artwork\u2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-123\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-123\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Building upon an Arts and Crafts legacy, diy culture is typically based on an explicit or implicit critique of disembodied and alienated industrial or institutional\u21b5 production for which it creates hands-on alternatives. This critique and practice can have Marxist, left-anarchist, religious-spiritual, green-ecologist, conservative, liberal, libertarian, and extreme right-wing ideological underpinnings. Racist organic farmers, for example, neofascist squatters, Nazi rock bands, motorbike repair shops of outlaw biker clubs, religious cult communes and Alt-Right meme collectives are among those who practice and make up radical diy culture. This renders political-ethical claims for diy culture just as dubious as any other fundamental political-ethical claim for subculture, let alone any romanticization of minorities on the pure grounds of their minority position.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-116\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-116\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Garnet Hertz, \u2018Two Terms: Critical Making + D.I.Y.\u2019, <i>conceptlab.com</i>, 2020, conceptlab.com/2terms/pdf/hertz-2terms-202011181901.pdf.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-117\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-117\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Such as the concepts of philosophical \u2018bricolage\u2019 by Jacques Derrida and Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss.

Feral Trade<sup id=\"cite_ref-124\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-124\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> is an artist-run grocery business\u21b5 and underground\u21b5 freight network, trading coffee, olive oil, dried bamboo shoots and other vital goods outside official channels since 2003. All the suppliers and all of the customers come through extended social networks. Goods hitchhike in the spare baggage space of friends, colleagues and passing acquaintances, while museums, offices, hotel reception desks, and other quasi-public places act as trans-shipment points and depots. An operation effectively like DHL, but without any employees, vans, facilities, or attempted delivery notes and without a business\u21b5 plan. While money does change hands, this is almost peripheral to the commitments and relations that keep the trade in motion. Instead, the core business\u21b5 of Feral Trade is in forging vivid, resurgent, and sociable supply chains, outside the logic of the market.\n</p><p>Calling this operation feral\u21b5 was initially a knee-jerk reaction to the excessive truth claims that \u2018fair\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 trade put out. I took up the word feral\u21b5 as an act of triangulation, connecting \u2018fair\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 to feral\u21b5 to complicate or scramble their confident affirmations. Beyond an easy play on words, I was also drawn to the icon of the feral\u21b5 pigeon, a well-known character that gets away with making a living in the margins of urban activity worldwide. It describes a way of operating that is wilfully wild or street-wild, as opposed to romantically wild (like the wolf). In terms of trade, what this approach amounts to is not some kind of heroic or folkloric revival of artisan trade practices. Instead, it is a diy\u21b5 endeavour with a scavenger\u2019s attitude to infrastructure that is inquisitive, encounter-based, opportunistic, and boundary-disregarding.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:MM_Pub21_V1_KR_B_Feral.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"MM Pub21 V1 KR B Feral.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e2/MM_Pub21_V1_KR_B_Feral.jpg/300px-MM_Pub21_V1_KR_B_Feral.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e2/MM_Pub21_V1_KR_B_Feral.jpg/450px-MM_Pub21_V1_KR_B_Feral.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/e/e2/MM_Pub21_V1_KR_B_Feral.jpg/600px-MM_Pub21_V1_KR_B_Feral.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:MM_Pub21_V1_KR_B_Feral.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>I am also aware of the more troubled connotations of the term. Being feral\u21b5 is normally a status conferred from outside with a mixture of description and emotion. While its objective meaning is the gone-wild descendants of formerly domesticated creatures, it is also used as an expression of annoyance or dislike. Its characteristics include being invasive, causing disruption, being undisciplined\u21b5 and disorderly, \u2018wandering all over the place\u2019 as literary and historical scholar Alexis Harley puts it<sup id=\"cite_ref-125\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-125\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><i>.</i> By contrast, the Feral Atlas project (see this lexicon) does not make judgements of feral\u21b5 phenomena but considers them in context. In their careful reading, the feral\u21b5 is not inherently the problem but a descriptive characteristic of the unintended effects of human infrastructure projects, producing entities that thrive outside human control.\n</p><p>Yet it is in this mixed messaging, its ambivalent character, that the feral\u21b5 gets interesting. Engaged outside its usual stamping ground of the nature/culture divide, I am intrigued by its potential to run interference in that other super-naturalized domain of business\u21b5. As a category that \u2018puts pressure on the idea of nature\u2019, in Harley\u2019s words, it applies stubborn resistance to a naturalized business\u21b5 ideology with its jungle laws of expedition, competition, and Darwinian survival. At the same time, the feral\u21b5 also signals a departure from the weighty imperatives in social and ethical business\u21b5 to always be \u2018good\u2019 or do \u2018right\u2019. That an individual enterprise or even a sector could be sustainable or responsible in an unsustainable, irresponsible system is \u2018implausible\u2019<i>,</i> as ecological thinkers and action research business\u21b5 scholars Judi Marshall, Peter Reason and Gillian Coleman underline.<sup id=\"cite_ref-126\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-126\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> We need some more down-to-earth assignments.\n</p><p>In this, I consider the feral\u21b5 as an opportune agent for our times: a scrappy role model, perhaps one-legged, poised to seek out the chinks in seeming impermeable yet arguably plentiful systems. An exemplar for living and working in the cracks\u2014being wild amongst, not wild apart\u2014with a management style that might be well suited for the troubled planetary relations in which we find ourselves. To further investigate this potential in company, I am starting up the Feral MBA, a radically reoriented training course in business\u21b5 for artists and others. Its founding intention is to enter and explore the murky territory of business\u21b5 in oblique, hopeful, hands-on and unstable ways, with the feral\u21b5 as its emblem.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-124\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-124\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">feraltrade.org.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-125\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-125\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Alexis Harley, \u2018Outlaws and Familiars\u2019, <i>Unlikely: Journal of the Creative Arts</i> 7 (2021), available at unlikely.net.au/issue-1/about-43.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-126\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-126\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Judi Marshall, Gill Coleman and Peter Reason, <i>Leadership for Sustainability: An Action Research Approach</i> (London: Routledge, 2011).</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"feral_2\">feral</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Feral2&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Feral2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\">Feral Atlas</span>\n</p><p>feral\u21b5 is not necessarily a negative or positive word; it has different meanings in different contexts. In Feral Atlas, feral\u21b5 refers to a nonhuman entity (biological, chemical, geological) that is beyond human control.\n</p><p>feral\u21b5 effects are all around us. Flora and fauna adapt to and transform ecologies in tune with their own cycles and rhythms beyond the anticipation and control of human activities all the time. An apple tree thrives after a forest visitor tosses the core after eating an apple, for example.\n</p><p>The feral\u21b5 effects Feral Atlas is concerned with are the unexpected, non-designed consequences of human-made imperial and industrial infrastructures, which materially transform land, water, and air with such intensity that shifts occur in formally stable nonhuman ecologies. These shifts can create favourable conditions for living or non-living entities to run out-of-control, whose feral\u21b5 activities tip these ecologies from one state to another. Jellyfish caused ecological disaster in the Black Sea after being accidentally brought there in ballast water in cargo ships, for example.\n</p><p>feral\u21b5 effects occur across multiple, overlapping, and uneven scales and often go unnoticed and unattended\u2014a consequence perhaps of the hubris of modernizing infrastructure projects\u2014and so feral\u21b5 effects pile up. This accumulation of feral\u21b5 effects shifts interactions between humans and nonhumans across scales, creating new, life-threatening ecological conditions. This, Feral Atlas argues, is the more-than-human Anthropocene.\n</p><p>In these critical times we argue that we need urgently to learn methods and practices of attention to what our infrastructures do. Rather looking at feral\u21b5 effects as a result, Feral Atlas asks, what triggers and encourages them?\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p>During the symposium Making Matters: Collective Material Practices in Critical Times, we (Feral Atlas members Lili Carr and Feifei Zhou) conducted a group exercise in noticing feral\u21b5 effects in the area where you live.

Its landscapes, its histories, its ecologies do not line up neatly. To study these more-than human worlds in active formation, Feral Atlas argues the need for multiple, multiperspectival accounts that are transdisciplinary\u21b5 in approach, method, and form.\n</p><p>Centuries of disciplinary precedent have siloed knowledge-making practices, making it difficult for scholars to study entangled Anthropocene histories that bring attention to humans and nonhumans at the same time. The following caricature is over-the-top, and yet there is a grain of truth in it: Humanists are severed heads floating in the stratosphere of philosophy, while scientists are toes grubbing in empirical dirt. Even in turning towards the concrete, humanists too often stop at an abstract discussion of \u2018materiality\u2019 before they even get to the material itself. Natural scientists ignore such discussions\u2014but to their peril; uninformed by humanist scholarship on politics, history, and culture, scientists too often grab simplistic and misleading paradigms for measuring humanity. None of these habits allow much in the way of conversation. Without this conversation, the false dichotomy of subservient Nature and mastering Culture continues to be affirmed.\n</p><p>Feral Atlas argues that bringing theoretical studies and field-based practices into dialogue\u2014often across lines of mutual unintelligibility and difference\u2014is essential for studying the Anthropocene. Feral Atlas contributors describe feral\u21b5 ecologies based on firsthand observation and assessment (including archival materials) each according to their practice. They are biologists, historians, anthropologists, geographers, climate scientists, artists, poets, and writers; their witnessing comes in various forms, from poetry and natural history to the painting of an Aboriginal artist and the memoir of a British professor. Sometimes, several reports follow the activities of a particular feral\u21b5 entity, revealing moments of both accord and disconnect. Just as with Anthropocene landscapes, Anthropocene knowledge does not line up neatly either.\n</p><p>During the symposium Making Matters: Collective Material Practices in Critical Times, we (Feral Atlas members Feifei Zhou and Lili Carr) conducted a workshop\u21b5 in noticing feral\u21b5 effects in the area where you live. The workshop\u21b5 took place online and therefore each participant, all coming from different disciplinary backgrounds and based in their respective homes across Europe, observed and recorded feral\u21b5 effects around them, each according to their practices. Sharing firsthand observations formed the basis for a rich discussion during the workshop\u21b5. A selection of recordings is reproduced below.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:1_-_Transdisciplinary.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/b/ba/1_-_Transdisciplinary.jpg/300px-1_-_Transdisciplinary.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"401\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/b/ba/1_-_Transdisciplinary.jpg/450px-1_-_Transdisciplinary.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/mediawiki/images/thumb/b/ba/1_-_Transdisciplinary.jpg/600px-1_-_Transdisciplinary.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:1_-_Transdisciplinary.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>1.

This in turn had led to a dilution of artistic values and to the dominance of mediocre art. The response of serious artists to this deterioration of art would be, according to Duchamp, \u2018an ascetic revolution\u2019.\n</p><p>A short elaboration on the notion of underground, as used by Duchamp, is needed here. Two years after Duchamp\u2019s lecture, the experimental film <i>Flaming Creatures</i> by American film director Jack Smith was first shown (at the Bleecker Street Cinema, on 29 April 1963). This film, which celebrates free and queer sex, marks the beginnings of the Underground Film Movement in New York, which would include artists and filmmakers such as Andy Warhol and the Kuchar brothers. The Underground Film Movement also developed ties with hippie subculture and is associated with the writers of the Beat Generation.<sup id=\"cite_ref-128\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-128\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>This is not the notion of underground that Duchamp was referring to. In my view, Duchamp talked about going underground in the sense of a secret operation, of disappearing from public view as an artist and going into hiding beneath the surface of the earth. How he dealt with his own last work, <i>\u00c9tant donn\u00e9s</i>, over a long period of some twenty years between 1946\u20131966 during which he was believed to have stopped making art altogether, can be seen as an example. underground is used here in a more literal sense, and that is how I will refer to the notion of underground in this essay. An early example is the case of Dick Raaijmakers (1930\u20132013), Dutch avantgarde composer, performance artist, and founder of Dutch electronic music in the 1950s. Raaijmakers once described his way of operating as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>I dig burrows underground and every once in a while, I stick my head above ground: hello, here I am! When I receive a blow on the head I go back into hiding, I dig further, and try again at a later point in time. If I am hit on the head once again, I withdraw again into the dark. Until finally somebody appreciates the value of my work and is willing to collaborate with me. That is the moment I can show something above ground.<sup id=\"cite_ref-129\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-129\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Going underground enables the artist to retain a certain freedom in carrying out the artistic practice, by severing ties with art institutions\u21b5 and remaining at a distance from the marketing system and from neoliberalist cultural policies.\n</p><p>We find ourselves right in the middle of, in Duchamp\u2019s terminology, such an \u2018ascetic revolution\u2019\u2014although this revolution differs from what Duchamp had in mind, the main difference being that \u2018the great artist of tomorrow\u2019, as Duchamp called him (for Duchamp, the artist is male), is largely absent as an individual. Forms of collectivity and collaboration are at the heart of the present ascetic revolution. Artists join forces in collective endeavours and projects on a global scale. In doing so, values that traditionally have determined artistic production in the Western world are abolished, such as personal signature, copyright, property, marketing values, fame, and the individuality of the artistic genius. All of the contributors to the Making Matters symposia and to the present book testify to this ascetic revolution. These artists have gone underground by withdrawing from the traditional platforms\u21b5 of the Western art world and by rendering themselves and their art to a certain extent invisible, that is, invisible as manifestations of individual art practices.<sup id=\"cite_ref-130\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-130\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Going underground might sound like a defeat to some readers, but in fact it means quite the opposite.<sup id=\"cite_ref-131\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-131\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Going underground is <i>not</i> an exodus from the art world and society, it is not a flight, a retreat, or a search for refuge. Going underground, in the sense it is used here, entails a refusal of solitary gestures\u21b5, and it aims for a re-grouping, a re-assembling, a re-connecting of forces, a re-configuring of social bonds. It is about&#160;<i>re</i>affirming relations, rather than about cutting ties. It is, therefore, a political act.\n</p><p><i>Politics of Withdrawal</i> (2020), a volume edited by the Dutch cultural theorists Joost de Blooijs and Pepita Hesselberth, addresses the meaning of withdrawal as a political act.<sup id=\"cite_ref-132\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-132\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In their introduction, \u2018Toward a Politics of Withdrawal?\u2019, De Blooijs and Hesselberth suggest that withdrawal\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>is not a retreat from actuality per se, but from certain of its aspects: from our present-day \u2018always-on\u2019 culture, from surveillance capitalism, from neo-liberal management, and so on. \u2026 The gesture interrupts the forward motion of late-capitalism, as withdrawal is not oriented toward the future but rather invested in the possibilities of a different way of life \u2026<sup id=\"cite_ref-133\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-133\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, underground artists resist the idea of art practice as a form of commercial entrepreneurship aimed at maximum financial profit for the individual entrepreneur, and they refuse to define the value of art as economic value. They distance themselves from neoliberalist policies, and from Western post-colonial dominance in the fields of art and culture. The ways in which this happens are manifold and may include practices that adapt late-capitalist technologies and systems (such as business\u21b5 models, the logistic\u21b5 of the warehouse and of digital distribution systems) to critically reflect on and inverse capitalist value systems. The distancing can equally happen as overt political activism or as a silent, un-outspoken way of operating that may lead to a certain degree of invisibility. Taking a distance therefore does not involve a negative act of withdrawal in the sense of refusal or seclusion (cf. Henry David Thoreau in <i>Walden</i>). Instead, it is a reconnecting that may take the shape of embeddedness\u21b5, of communality or radical inclusivity.\n</p><p>The critique of global capitalist logistic\u21b5 structures and the questioning of the place of technology in culture does not necessarily prevent a positive embracing of new technologies. In fact, a precondition for going underground seems to be an active engagement with the Internet and with technical infrastructures, enabling an opening up of new zones of global collaboration and political action. Thinking with, and through, digital technology and its role in the co-existence of humans and other-than-humans is precisely one of the focal points of the new underground art.\n</p>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-127\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-127\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://invisiblecity.uarts.edu/where-do-we-go-from-here\">https://invisiblecity.uarts.edu/where-do-we-go-from-here</a><u>,</u> accessed 3 May 2021.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-128\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-128\">\u2191</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William S.

The government\u2019s cultural policy had boiled down to scrapping arts-related research in favour of digital technology research and development (based on a partial misinterpretation of \u2018creative industries\u2019 as Silicon Valley-style start-ups). Funding for contemporary art was cut, too, in favour of programmes for the creative industries. These policies have caused much wilful damage to the art world in the Netherlands over the past fifteen years.\n</p><p>The representatives of these five institutions came together as the Workgroup Making Matters to explore ways of bridging art, design, and technology as an alternative to the paradigm of \u2018creative industries\u2019.\n</p><p>The research project and the book are financed by the Smart Culture programme of the Dutch Research Council (NWO).\n</p><p>We received a great amount of support from colleagues in our field: Lotte Betting, Loes Bogers, ginger coons, Garnet Hertz, Emily Huurdeman, Janneke van Kersen (NW), Shailoh Phillips, Rosalien van der Poel, Marielle Verdijk.\n</p><p>We thank Hackers &amp; Designers for their collaboration and the design of the book.\n</p><p>We thank Het Nieuwe Instituut, West Den Haag and Waag for contributing the work and research time of their people.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"contributors\">contributors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Biographies&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-1\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Biographies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"author\"> </span>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Authors_and_Editors\">Authors and Editors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Biographies&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=T-2\" class=\"mw-editsection-visualeditor\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-divider\"> | </span><a href=\"/wiki/mediawiki/index.php?title=Biographies&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Edit section: \">edit source</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Aliens in Green</b> (Bureau d\u2019\u00e9tudes, Ewen Chardronnet, Mary Maggic, Julien Maudet, \u0160pela Petri\u010d) is an investigative laboratory and tactical theatre group combating the alien agents of anthropogenic xeno-power.
